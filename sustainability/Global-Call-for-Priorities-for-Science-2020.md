This file hosts a contribution to the [Global Call for Priorities for Science](https://council.science/science-funding/global-call/), which is described on its homepage as follows:

> With just ten years to go to achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the UNâ€™s 2030 Agenda, science funders from around the world have asked the International Science Council (ISC) to convene the insights and ideas of the broader global scientific community on the critical priorities for science that will support and enable societies to accomplish the goals by 2030. We want to hear from scientists in all fields and all disciplines, including the natural, social and human sciences.
> 
> The idea behind this call is to identify priorities for game-changing action in two related domains:
> 
> 1. Science for sustainability transformations: promoting mission-driven research that harnesses solutions-oriented knowledge from across the spectrum of scientific disciplines and approaches, including fundamental research; adopts a systems-based approach; and informs policy and public action through trans-disciplinary engagement with relevant decision makers and innovators from the worlds of policy, civil society and business.
> 1. Transformations of science systems: supporting the evolution of science systems in order to support their effective contribution to the 2030 Agenda; including the development of open science systems, the promotion of trans-disciplinary approaches to knowledge generation, knowledge brokerage and science advisory ecosystems, scientific capacity needs at individual, institutional and policy levels, as well as systems of research incentives.
> 
> This is a unique opportunity for the international science community to advise science funders about the support that science needs in order to maximize its impact on the achievement of the SDGs in the next decade. What are the critical knowledge or data, as well as capacity gaps that funders should be addressing? And how do science and related funding systems need to change in order to amplify and accelerate impactful science?
> 
> > Help us shape the international science funding agenda by sharing your views through this survey and participating in the Decade of Global Sustainability Science Action.


To this end, it poses a number of questions, to which I will compile my responses below:

# 1. What do you regard as being the most critical priority to be addressed in the coming decade in order for science to support and enable societies to achieve the SDGs?

# 2. What critical gaps in knowledge, data and/or science systems development would this priority action address?

# 3. What concrete result(s) (outcomes/impacts) would it seek to achieve, and how could success be measured? 

# 4. What level of societal engagement and what key partnerships would be required to ensure success?

# 5. If possible, could you provide an estimation of the type/level of investment that would ideally be required to support this action?

# 6. How, in your opinion, should science funding systems change in order to more effectively enable science to make progress on addressing the challenges of global sustainability?

# 7. What do you regard as the biggest challenge that the COVID-19 pandemic poses to science? And the biggest opportunity?

# 8. Any other comments?
