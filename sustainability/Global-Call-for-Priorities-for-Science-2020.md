# About

This file hosts a contribution to the [Global Call for Priorities for Science](https://council.science/science-funding/global-call/), which is described on its homepage as follows:

> With just ten years to go to achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the UNâ€™s 2030 Agenda, science funders from around the world have asked the International Science Council (ISC) to convene the insights and ideas of the broader global scientific community on the critical priorities for science that will support and enable societies to accomplish the goals by 2030. We want to hear from scientists in all fields and all disciplines, including the natural, social and human sciences.
> 
> The idea behind this call is to identify priorities for game-changing action in two related domains:
> 
> 1. Science for sustainability transformations: promoting mission-driven research that harnesses solutions-oriented knowledge from across the spectrum of scientific disciplines and approaches, including fundamental research; adopts a systems-based approach; and informs policy and public action through trans-disciplinary engagement with relevant decision makers and innovators from the worlds of policy, civil society and business.
> 1. Transformations of science systems: supporting the evolution of science systems in order to support their effective contribution to the 2030 Agenda; including the development of open science systems, the promotion of trans-disciplinary approaches to knowledge generation, knowledge brokerage and science advisory ecosystems, scientific capacity needs at individual, institutional and policy levels, as well as systems of research incentives.
> 
> This is a unique opportunity for the international science community to advise science funders about the support that science needs in order to maximize its impact on the achievement of the SDGs in the next decade. What are the critical knowledge or data, as well as capacity gaps that funders should be addressing? And how do science and related funding systems need to change in order to amplify and accelerate impactful science?
> 
> > Help us shape the international science funding agenda by sharing your views through this survey and participating in the Decade of Global Sustainability Science Action.


To this end, it poses a number of questions, to which I will compile my responses below:

# 1. What do you regard as being the most critical priority to be addressed in the coming decade in order for science to support and enable societies to achieve the SDGs?

- **Apply the scientific method onto the research ecosystem itself** 
  - Within and across all fields of research, we need to *apply the scientific method transparently, reproducibly and systematically* to the questions of why and how we support, perform, share, communicate, evaluate and improve research.

# 2. What critical gaps in knowledge, data and/or science systems development would this priority action address?

It would help address
1. inefficiencies of the current research ecosystem, including perverse incentives, hypercompetition, lack of reproducibility and diversity, or the inconsisten signaling of opportunities to engage
1. misconceptions about the role of science in society, including with regards to supporting economic growth, advising on policy, contributing to education or the well-being of humans and their natural and social environments

# 3. What concrete result(s) (outcomes/impacts) would it seek to achieve, and how could success be measured? 

The first outcome would hopefully be a fruitful discussion about design features and other aspects of the current research ecosystem(s) that stand in the way of adequately meeting the expectations that underlie our societies' motivations for supporting research.

On that basis, I would expect systematic reviews, randomized controlled studies and other evidence-gathering exercises that identify such problematic aspects transparently, reproducibly and systematically and explore potential options to address them, thereby providing a factual basis for the above discussions.

A further layer of outcomes would be a set of research-related policies (and practices) &mdash; all around the research cycle &mdash; for which the rationale behind individual policy elements or practical steps is made explicit (think evidence-based funding) and can thus be scrutinized by other stakeholders. On the basis of 

that meet certain minimum requirements in terms of how well their parameterization 

# 4. What level of societal engagement and what key partnerships would be required to ensure success?


# 5. If possible, could you provide an estimation of the type/level of investment that would ideally be required to support this action?

# 6. How, in your opinion, should science funding systems change in order to more effectively enable science to make progress on addressing the challenges of global sustainability?

- shift the emphasis from static publications of narratives about research to dynamic availability, reproducibility and reusability of most or all components of the respective research cycles
- require an open-by-default approach to documenting research, allowing for justified exceptions
- shift the emphasis from project funding to funding people
- shift the emphasis of prizes from individuals to teams
- shift the emphasis from evaluating proposed work (especially grant proposals) and the potential impacts to evaluating past and ongoing work and actual impacts
- when evaluating research and researchers, consider societal impact alongside impact on the research or specific research fields

# 7. What do you regard as the biggest challenge that the COVID-19 pandemic poses to science? And the biggest opportunity?

- Challenges:
  - the pandemic has interrupted lots of science-related workflows and depleted potential funding sources
- Opportunities:
  - test-driving transformational responses to the climate emergency
  - increased speed of sharing, e.g. via preprints
  - higher appreciation for remote work
    - opens the door for having international faculty, working from around the globe
  - higher appreciation of planetary boundaries both inside the research ecosystem and in society at large

# 8. Any other comments?

# Notes

*Consider putting this onto Zenodo.*

- "Intellectual property"
- redefine - or dump - "Excellence"
- "Public participation"
- circular economy-like spiral of reusability of research outcomes
- mention related references in 8
- under 6, add sustainability of funding
- under 6, add research ideas/ cycles being public and funders combing through to identify promising patterns and/ or monitor systemic progress towards targets
- include environmental footprint considerations in research budgeting
- emphasize actual reuse (e.g. in replications, teaching, services)
- clarify that that role in the long term is to inform sustainable development.
- machines as colleaborators
- applicable policy
- planetary pledges
