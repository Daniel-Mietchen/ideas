This file hosts a contribution to the [Global Call for Priorities for Science](https://council.science/science-funding/global-call/), which is described on its homepage as follows:

> With just ten years to go to achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the UN’s 2030 Agenda, science funders from around the world have asked the International Science Council (ISC) to convene the insights and ideas of the broader global scientific community on the critical priorities for science that will support and enable societies to accomplish the goals by 2030. We want to hear from scientists in all fields and all disciplines, including the natural, social and human sciences.
> 
> The idea behind this call is to identify priorities for game-changing action in two related domains:
> 
> 1. Science for sustainability transformations: promoting mission-driven research that harnesses solutions-oriented knowledge from across the spectrum of scientific disciplines and approaches, including fundamental research; adopts a systems-based approach; and informs policy and public action through trans-disciplinary engagement with relevant decision makers and innovators from the worlds of policy, civil society and business.
> 1. Transformations of science systems: supporting the evolution of science systems in order to support their effective contribution to the 2030 Agenda; including the development of open science systems, the promotion of trans-disciplinary approaches to knowledge generation, knowledge brokerage and science advisory ecosystems, scientific capacity needs at individual, institutional and policy levels, as well as systems of research incentives.
> 
> This is a unique opportunity for the international science community to advise science funders about the support that science needs in order to maximize its impact on the achievement of the SDGs in the next decade. What are the critical knowledge or data, as well as capacity gaps that funders should be addressing? And how do science and related funding systems need to change in order to amplify and accelerate impactful science?
> 
> > Help us shape the international science funding agenda by sharing your views through this survey and participating in the Decade of Global Sustainability Science Action.


To this end, it poses a number of questions, to which I will compile my responses below:

# 1. What do you regard as being the most critical priority to be addressed in the coming decade in order for science to support and enable societies to achieve the SDGs?

- **Apply the scientific method onto the research ecosystem itself** 
  - Within and across all fields of research, we need to *apply the scientific method transparently, reproducibly and systematically* to the questions of why and how we support, perform, share, communicate, evaluate and improve research.

# 2. What critical gaps in knowledge, data and/or science systems development would this priority action address?

It would help address
1. inefficiencies of the current research ecosystem, including perverse incentives, hypercompetition, lack of reproducibility and diversity, the non-sustainable funding of open infrastructures, the slow uptake of many research results in relevant contexts, or the inconsistent signaling of opportunities to engage with research
1. misconceptions about the role of science in society, including with regards to supporting economic growth, advising on policy, contributing to education or the well-being of humans and their natural and social environments

# 3. What concrete result(s) (outcomes/impacts) would it seek to achieve, and how could success be measured? 

The first outcome would hopefully be a fruitful discussion about design features and other aspects of the current research ecosystem(s) that stand in the way of adequately meeting the expectations that underlie our societies' motivations for supporting research.

On that basis, I would expect systematic reviews, randomized controlled studies and other evidence-gathering exercises that identify such problematic aspects transparently, reproducibly and systematically and explore potential options to address them, thereby providing a factual basis for the above discussions.

A further layer of outcomes would be a set of research-related policies and (documented) practices &mdash; all around the research cycle &mdash; that explicitly reference the evidence underlying the choices and parametrization of specific policy elements or practical workflows. Such explicit referencing invites constructive criticism, which can form the basis of more transparent and collaborative approaches to designing policies and workflows.

With research-related policies and practices becoming more evidence-based, I would expect the critical gaps outlined in question 2 to be more closely studied, perhaps similar ones discovered and, ultimately, sustainable solutions towards their reduction developed.

# 4. What level of societal engagement and what key partnerships would be required to ensure success?

We would need a set of diverse but interacting stakeholders willing to apply the scientific method onto the research ecosystem and around different elements of the research cycle: researchers, funders, institutions, research policymakers, research evaluators, research communicators, research infrastructure providers and so on.

# 5. If possible, could you provide an estimation of the type/level of investment that would ideally be required to support this action?

If a research funder were to invest on the order of 3%-5% of their budget into applying the scientific method to the way they fund science, I would expect that investment to fully pay for itself (and probably some more) within 3-5 years. Given the multiple inefficiencies in the current science funding systems and the continuous changes in the world around them, I would expect a rate of about 2%-3% to be useful &mdash; and cost-neutral or better &mdash; in the long term.

# 6. How, in your opinion, should science funding systems change in order to more effectively enable science to make progress on addressing the challenges of global sustainability?

Science funding systems should
- map their own activities more closely to sustainability measures, e.g. by explicitly tying funding programs and research evaluation criteria to the targets and indicators of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals
- make public pledges about reducing their environmental footprint
- require an open-by-default approach to research workflows and research assessment, allowing for justified exceptions
- become more transparent and participatory themselves, e.g. share more of their data and workflows, or delegate some of their budgeting authority to public community mechanisms
- make their own outputs - from classical publications to data, code, policies, funding calls, reviews and similar documentation - FAIR by default
- use such FAIRness to monitor compliance with their policies
- require environmental footprint considerations to be included in research budgets
- dump the concepts of 
  - "economic growth" &mdash; and reframe relevant activities and actions in terms of a circular economy instead
  - "excellence" &mdash; or redefine it to include notions of equity, sustainability, collaboration and public outreach
- fund 
  - research units to study existing science funding systems systematically, to develop and test alternative approaches and to assist with systemic adoption of demonstrated improvements
  - replication studies systematically
  - duplications consciously rather than accidentally
  - robust levels of emergency preparedness steadily across the research system
  - emergency responses quickly
  - mechanisms that assist researchers in identifying "applicable policy" related to their research
- shift the emphasis
  - from funding short-term projects to sustainably funding people, infrastructures and collaboration
  - from evaluating proposed work (especially grant proposals) and potential impacts (e.g. of manuscripts or grant proposals) to evaluating past and ongoing work and already demonstrated impacts
  - from non-publicly reviewing non-public materials (e.g. grant proposals, output management plans) to publicly engaging with open-science resources like open notebooks or publicly posted research ideas, proposals and output management plans
  - from valuing static publications of narratives about research to valuing dynamic availability, reproducibility and reusability of research outcomes
  - from glacial speed of funding decisions to quickly approving everyone who demonstrably meets certain eligibility criteria, or a random subset
  - of prizes from individuals to teams
  - of science communication and education from advertising "finished" (and branded) research products to engagement with the research process and its iterations

# 7. What do you regard as the biggest challenge that the COVID-19 pandemic poses to science? And the biggest opportunity?

- Challenges:
  - the pandemic has 
    - personally affected lots of individuals in the research ecosystem, in multiple ways
    - affected society as a whole, with both direct and indirect effects on the research ecosystem
    - interrupted lots of research-related workflows
    - depleted potential sources of research funding
    - drained the budgets of research unrelated to the pandemic in favour of research addressing the pandemic
    - amplified inequities within and beyond the research ecosystem
    - brought about an ecosystem of misinformation, the fighting of which is necessary but detracts researchers from other activities
    - highlighted that the current framing of copyright, patents and similar "intellectual property" is highly misaligned with societal benefit
- Opportunities:
  - the pandemic  
    - can help humanity and its research ecosystem in test-driving transformational responses to other emergencies, especially the climate emergency and the ever more frequent and more severe disasters triggered by it
    - increased the breadth, depth and speed at which research is being shared (e.g. via preprints or data and code repositories), which can serve as a case study for adopting such higher levels of sharing in other research contexts
    - has contributed to a higher appreciation of 
      - planetary boundaries and how they relate to the research ecosystem and society at large
      - openly accessible resources
      - remote work and collaboration
        - this opens the door for a wider adoption of teams whose members are working from around the globe
      - suitably designed machines and automated systems as collaborators of researchers
    - has forced scientific meetings online, reducing their environmental footprint and spurring the development of new formats
