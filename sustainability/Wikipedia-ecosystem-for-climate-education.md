The Wikipedia ecosystem as a component of climate education

One of the key activities in Climate Reality contexts is to educate people about climate, climate change, climate mitigation, climate action and related matters. To do this successfully, a number of factors have to be considered, including reach to a wide audience, which is why I would like to suggest that Climate Reality consider engaging more with Wikipedia and the ecosystem of websites around it.

Wikipedia is one of the top websites in the World by traffic, and the only one in the top that presents its contents to users for free, under open licenses, with an educational mission instead of advertisements or tracking. It exists in about 300 languages and forms the centerpiece of an entire ecosystem of about 1000 wikis primarily arranged by information channel - Wikipedia as the encyclopedia, Wikisource as a text archive, Wikimedia Commons as a media repository, Wikidata as a knowledge base and so on, with sites like Wikivoyage, Wikispecies, Wikiversity, Wikinews, Wikiquote or Wiktionary further enriching the mix.

Each of these platforms comes with an existing community, existing content and existing open-source tools, but anyone is invited to contribute. Climate-related matters are represented there in several ways: for instance, content pages like  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming
summarize what is known on a particular topic, WikiProject pages like  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Climate_change help the community coordinate activities around a topic area, portals like
Portal:Klimawandel present the information to human users, and Automated Programming Interfaces like https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php are amongst the options to make it accessible to machines.

From what I have learned about Climate Reality so far, I think it would benefit from closer interaction with the open knowledge ecosystem around Wikipedia, which is probably the most popular platform globally for providing information regarding climate-related issues and solutions. I shall be most happy to help with that.
