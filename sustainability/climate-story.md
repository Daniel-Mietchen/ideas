# Sustainability-minded

I grew up in an area surrounded by chemical plants, which has left a direct imprint on the environment - e.g. fresh snow was often grey - as well as a more indirect one on my personal health. Doctors thus recommended that I should spend time in less polluted environments, particularly at the sea or in the mountains. I always enjoyed those times, for various reasons, and the obvious health benefits contributed to sensitizing me for environmental matters and nicely complemented my broader interests in the natural world that I had been developing from early on.

By the time of the Chernobyl disaster, I had read my way through multiple library shelves, and from browsing associated catalogs, I knew in broad strokes what else they had on offer and where. So I went to our local branch and found a range of useful resources that explained to me nuclear energy, radiation and their effects on various organisms, including humans. What I did not find there or elsewhere was reliable information about the environmental and health implications of this particular nuclear accident, neither for Chernobyl itself, nor for areas closer to where I was.

From then on, I paid close attention to environmental matters, both as a natural phenomenon and as a potentially political issue. About four years later, the country that I had grown up in until my teenage years disappeared from the map, another system took over the land and its inhabitants, and sustainability issues have been on my mind ever since.
