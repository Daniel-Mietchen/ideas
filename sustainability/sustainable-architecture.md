# About

This file collects information related to [sustainable architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_architecture). I am rather new to this field but motivated to get engaged with it since the built environment &mdash; along its entire lifecycle &mdash; is a key contributor to our environmental footprint and a key determinant of transportation patterns.
