# Frequently Asked Questions

* Why am I posting my ideas in public?
  - I am interested in the spread of ideas, so chipping in some of my own just seems fair game.
  - I am also interested in collaboration, and that often starts with an idea.
  - Sharing ideas openly helps them travel faster and more widely and to interact with more brains and other ideas.
  - Most researchers and many others have more ideas than they can ever put into practice in their lifetime. That includes me.
* Aren't some of these ideas more like entries from a to-do list?
  - Yes. I have been keeping a range of to-do lists in various places and am gradually moving my research-related ones to more public places.
