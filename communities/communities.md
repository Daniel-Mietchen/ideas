# About

This file hosts information regarding communities, organizations or other initiatives with which I have actively engaged in 2025. This listing — alphabetical by URL — is very incomplete and will likely remain so, but I am planning to interconnect it with my [yearly priorities](https://www.google.com/search?q=../new-year-resolutions). One way of engagement is through events, which I am [documenting separately](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/blob/master/communities/events.md).
