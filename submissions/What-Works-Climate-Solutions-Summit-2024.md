# Abstract Title

Climate literacy and Wikimedia projects

# Abstract
*(300 words maximum)*

As climate-related matters are affecting ever more aspects of ever more people's lives, it is important to provide reliable information that helps to understand the issues and their ramifications, including potential solutions and the conditions under which they might or might not work. In this context, Wikimedia projects - i.e. Wikipedia and its sister sites like Wikidata and Wikimedia Commons - can and do play an important role by providing general reference information on multiple facets of the climate landscape, in a place where people and machines are looking for such information, in languages that they can understand and in ways that allow anyone to participate. This contribution will provide a guided tour around various climate solutions, the underlying issues and how they are reflected in the content and in the workflows of various Wikimedia projects. The discussion will include biases and gaps in coverage as well as opportunities for other actors in the climate solution and climate literacy space to engage with the Wikimedia platforms' contents, communities or technology stack.
