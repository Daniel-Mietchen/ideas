This file collects information pertaining to a submission to the [BiCIKL Call for Expression of Interest for biodiversity data-related scientific proposals](https://bicikl-project.eu/open-call-projects), as per https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/1728 .

Here is a first draft on the three required core bits:

# Description of the idea
*Maximum 250 words.*

Cross-species interactions in invasion contexts: the case of pollination networks

I would like to encourage the BiCIKL project partners to zoom in on the rapid response workflow for biological invasions that was sketched out as Exemplar Use Case 1 in the BiCIKL proposal and shown to provide a useful framework for integration efforts across the consortium. Within this context, I would like cross-species interactions - particularly zoophilous pollination networks - to receive special attention as an additional avenue for highlighting and perhaps streamlining the integration of research workflows across different data infrastructures, since pollinators and their pollination partners are not typically kept in close proximity in natural history collections nor closely synchronized in biodiversity databases. 

Biotic invasions have multiple facets, and research about them spans across taxonomic, geographic and other boundaries, requiring rich data about the invading organisms as well as the invaded spaces and their respective ecological contexts. Yet such data are rarely available in a way that would render them readily usable in invasion sciences, so there is a need for closer integration between data infrastructures covering taxonomic, genetic, biochemical, behavioral, biomorphological, geomorphological, land use, climate and other data, including about cross-species interactions.
 

# Data required
*Maximum 150 words.*

We need taxonomic, occurrence, sequencing, trait and other data about species that (1) are pollinating or zoophilously pollinated and (2) have invasive populations. Such data are needed primarily about the target species and their pollination partners, but would ideally include data pertaining to their respective habitats (e.g. eDNA, weather, climate), competitors, parasites, prey and predators - perhaps along with human activities influencing these variables - in both the alien and the native ranges and at relevant spatial (from microscopic to macroscopic, both within and across climate zones) and temporal (e.g. diurnal cycle, individual life cycle, annual seasons, decadal trends) scales. Besides BiCIKL infrastructures (possibly even all of them), this would involve at least Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI) as well as the Wikimedia ecosystem (as both provider and reuser of data), particularly through Wikidata and Wikimedia Commons.


# Outcomes envisaged
*Maximum 100 words.*

1. an assessment of quality and comprehensiveness of data about species involved in both pollination and invasions
1. a categorization of the resulting information as to which issues of relevance to biotic invasions it could help to address - particularly with respect to invasion pathways, invasion success, invasion impact and invasion management
1. visualizations of gaps and trends
1. communicating the above to relevant stakeholders, from researchers to practitioners, policy makers, educators and the broader public
