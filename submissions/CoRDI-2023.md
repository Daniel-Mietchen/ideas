## Title

Leveraging FAIR data and services to reduce bureaucracy in the research ecosystem

## Abstract

The research community has long acknowledged the importance of good data management practices for scientific progress. The emergence of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) Principles has further highlighted the significance of making research data and metadata available in a more transparent and consistent fashion. While FAIR data and services are clearly not intended to add to the workload of researchers, efforts towards the practical implementation of the FAIR Principles are often seen as yet another administrative burden. Researchers may feel that they already have a lot on their plate and that they do not have the time or resources to comply with all pertinent regulations. This perception is particularly prevalent among smaller research groups that lack the necessary infrastructure to manage and share research data, software and related resources. Here, I would like to outline how the growing availability of FAIR data, FAIR services, FAIR software and FAIR objects more generally could be leveraged to reduce bureaucracy and streamline research practices.

## Title

Research in the Age of Integration between Research and Society: Implications for Data Literacy and Data Sovereignty

## Abstract

The research landscape has undergone a significant transformation in recent years, driven by complex interactions between technological advances and changing societal expectations. One of the most notable changes is the integration of research workflows with processes and infrastructures that were not traditionally seen as part of the research ecosystem. This integration has led to a blurring of boundaries between different sectors and domains, creating new opportunities for collaboration and innovation. However, it also poses challenges for data literacy and data sovereignty, which are critical for all stakeholders involved in research.

In this talk, we will explore how the integration of research with other domains, such as industry, government, and civil society, is reshaping the research landscape. We will discuss how new modes of collaboration, including public-private partnerships and citizen science initiatives, are changing the way research is conducted and how data is collected, analyzed, and disseminated. We will also examine the implications of these changes for data literacy and data sovereignty and the need to ensure that all stakeholders have the necessary skills and processes to engage appropriately with data.

We will argue that data literacy is not just a technical skill, but a critical component of democratic citizenship, and that increased data literacy will necessitate adjustments in terms of how the research ecosystem handles and shapes data sovereignty.
