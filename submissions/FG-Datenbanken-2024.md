# Title

Wikidata as a FAIR and multilingual interface to the research ecosystem

# Abstract

The practice of data sharing is slowly but surely reaching further and deeper into scholarly realms, and an increasing share of such data meets at least some of the FAIR Principles. On that basis, it is increasingly possible for research data to be found and used by people and processes with no close relationship to the original research context, which opens up both opportunities and challenges. This contribution focuses on opportunities, specifically those provided by integrating research resources with [Wikidata](https://wikidata.org/), a FAIR and public-domain database providing general reference information spanning all domains of scholarly knowledge. Aligned with thousands of databases and with terminologies in many languages, it can serve as a multilingual interface to the research ecosystem, including to resources originally available in a very small number of languages or even just one.
