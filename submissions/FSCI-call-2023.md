# About

This file hosts materials related to my submission (as per [issue 1740](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/1740)) for [FSCI 2023](https://force11.org/fsci/2023/) &mdash; the FORCE11 Scholarly Communication Institute (FSCI) taking place online on July 31 - August 4, 2023.

# Application form

A copy of the application form is [here](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/1740#issuecomment-1404378112), and I will draft the non-trivial or non-personal bits below.

## Course title

An introduction to Wikidata-based scholarly profiling via Scholia: Exploring the research ecosystem the open way

## Course abstract
*250-500 words*

This course will provide its participants with practical know-how about how key elements of the research ecosystem can be profiled using open data and open-source software and in a way that encourages collaborative curation.

Scholia is a web service that profiles dozens of types of entities commonly found in the research ecosystem, from researchers and their publications to journals and institutions, from funders and events to software taxa, genes or metabolic pathways. The underlying data is from Wikidata, a multilingual general-purpose FAIR database originating from the Wikipedia ecosystem.

## Course outline
*Please provide a brief outline of the planned course content and activities over the three class days, including any anticipated assignments and the approximate duration for each class (range of 60-180 minutes per session). This information is to help Program Committee reviewers assess your proposal and will not be listed as part of the course abstract should your course be selected. Details may also change as you prepare the course.*

Data exploration, quality control and curation

## Teaching experience

Lots of workshops around open scientific knowledge, and occasional courses, including FSCI ones, both on-site (2017) and remotely (2018)

## Virtual engagement

*Please describe your strategy for engagement and interaction with students, leveraging online learning modalities to promote active learning. Keep in mind the global reach of FSCI and the different time zones and technologies that students may have.*

The main idea here is that participants will help curate the information that their virtual neighbours are interested in. In order to make that useful, they have to coordinate and perhaps find intersections to their own interests.

## Previous iterations

My past FSCI courses were trying to give a good overview of Wikidata and mentioned Scholia only briefly. This course would be focused on Scholia and only cover those Wikidata aspects directly related to it, with special attention to integration with research and teaching workflows as well as metadata curation.

## Student prerequisites

Course participants should create an account on Wikidata and use it to sign up on the course page at least one week in advance of the course start. That page will have additional instructions similar to those at https://w.wiki/6GC8 and also provide options to signal particular interests that I can incorporate. 

## Target audience

Knowledge workers, from student to professional in any domain of knowledge. By default, I will have examples of interest to researchers (particularly in the biomedical, environmental and mathematical sciences, linguistics and science history) as well as to students, instructors, librarians, data stewards, journalists, journal editors, peer reviewers, funders and research administrators.

## Main topics

open science, FAIR workflows, literature search, data visualization, data exploration, data modelling, data quality, data curation, collaborative curation, bibliometrics, scientometrics, linked open data, knowledge graph, scholarly profiling

## Technical requirements

No requirements beyond stable connectivity, but opportunities to put technical or domain knowledge to good use. Having access to two screens is probably beneficial, but certainly not essential.
