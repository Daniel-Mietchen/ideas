## Course title

An introduction to Wikidata-based scholarly profiling via Scholia: Exploring the research ecosystem the open way

## Course abstract
*250-500 words*

In this course, participants will learn how key elements of the research ecosystem can be profiled in a way that enhances the global impact of open scholarship. The key ingredients are (i) open and FAIR data from Wikidata, (ii) Scholia and other free and open-source tools to explore and curate the content in Wikidata and other parts of the Wikipedia ecosystem, (iii) a global and highly collaborative community of curators that the participants will join, and (iv) a guided tour through all of this, with a series of hands-on activities highlighting different aspects of the profiles, the data, the software, the community or associated technical, ethical or content issues.

Scholia - located at https://scholia.toolforge.org/ - is a web service that profiles dozens of types of entities commonly found in the research ecosystem, from researchers and their research topics to publications, journals, publishers and institutions, from funders and events to awards, software, taxa, genes or metabolic pathways. The more open and FAIR a scholarly entity and metadata about it are, the more aspects of it Scholia can feature. It visualizes data about these entities from Wikidata - a multilingual FAIR database of general-purpose reference data - and assists its users in exploring entities of interest as well as in curating content related to them. The resulting curation, in turn, helps not only improve the corresponding profiles but also - since all of the data is freely available to humans and machines - facilitates various forms of reuse, both within and beyond Wikidata.

After attending the course, participants will (i) be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of the Wikidata-powered Scholia profiles, (ii) have practical experience in open and collaborative curation of profile-related data and (iii) understand how Scholia profiles and queries can be adapted for specific use cases and reuse scenarios.

## Course outline
*Please provide a brief outline of the planned course content and activities over the three class days, including any anticipated assignments and the approximate duration for each class (range of 60-180 minutes per session). This information is to help Program Committee reviewers assess your proposal and will not be listed as part of the course abstract should your course be selected. Details may also change as you prepare the course.*

After a basic introduction to Scholia and some related Wikidata features, the course will cover a set of common scenarios for using Scholia or adapting some aspects of it for specific purposes. These scenarios highlight data exploration, data quality control and collaborative curation workflows, with excursions into data modelling, the exploration of biases, the generation of research questions and the relationship between data visualization and narrative text.

Each of the three class days will start with an introductory presentation that builds on the preparatory homework, followed by practical hands-on activities in pairs or small groups and concluding with a full-group activity in which documentation, experiences and thoughts pertaining to the session are being shared. Questions will be possible throughout the sessions. My preferred session length per course day would be 180 minutes, with 5 min each hour dedicated to documentation and additional 5 to breaks.

The days will be themed: Day 1 ("Exploration") will focus on what is already there in Wikidata and Scholia, how it works and when it can be useful, while Day 2 ("Curation") will zoom in on assessing and improving data quality and coverage, and Day 3 ("Adaptation") will explore ways in which the existing Scholia system could be modified to better suit use cases of interest to course participants.

## Teaching experience

Lots of workshops, talks and hackathons around open scientific knowledge, along with occasional courses, including FSCI ones, both on-site (2017) and remote (2018). Few of these have been recorded, but some examples relevant to the course sit at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weYWFgr1ZNc and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7226858 .

## Virtual engagement

*Please describe your strategy for engagement and interaction with students, leveraging online learning modalities to promote active learning. Keep in mind the global reach of FSCI and the different time zones and technologies that students may have.*

The main idea here is that participants will (i) provide some use cases or pick from some that I present, (ii) help each other curate (via Wikidata) and visualize (via Scholia) information pertaining to these use cases, and (iii) document their observations and share them with other course participants and perhaps the wider world.

## Previous iterations

My past FSCI courses were trying to give a good overview of Wikidata and mentioned Scholia only briefly. This course would be focused on Scholia and only cover those Wikidata aspects directly related to it, with special attention to integration with research and teaching workflows as well as metadata curation.

## Student prerequisites

Course participants should create an account on Wikidata and use it to sign up on the course page at https://w.wiki/6GNZ at least one week in advance of the course start. That page has suggestions for preparatory materials and will have additional instructions similar to those at https://w.wiki/6GC8 . It will also provide options to signal particular interests to which I will try to cater. 

## Target audience

Knowledge workers, from student to professional in any domain of knowledge. By default, I will have examples of interest to researchers (particularly in the biomedical, environmental and mathematical sciences, linguistics and science history) as well as to students, instructors, librarians, data stewards, journalists, journal editors, peer reviewers, funders and research administrators.

## Main topics

open science, FAIR workflows, literature search, data visualization, data exploration, data modelling, data quality, data curation, collaborative curation, bibliometrics, scientometrics, linked open data, knowledge graph, scholarly profiling

## Technical requirements

No requirements beyond stable connectivity, yet multiple opportunities to put technical or domain knowledge or language skills to good use. Having access to two screens is probably beneficial, but certainly not essential.
