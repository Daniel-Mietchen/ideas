# About

This file hosts a contribution to the [Leibniz MMS Days 2024](https://www.wias-berlin.de/workshops/MMSDays24/) taking place on 10-12 April 2024 in Kaiserslautern. MMS stands for "Mathematical Modeling and Simulation".

# Title

Navigating a landscape of shared models and simulations: opportunities and challenges

# Abstract

As mathematical models and simulations arising from research are being shared more widely, they can be used more readily outside their original context. This opens up new opportunities and challenges. The opportunities include improved feasibility of reproducibility assessments, a broader range of potential applications, combinations and modifications as well as an improved basis for research collaborations and education involving models and simulations. The challenges include how to share models and associated materials such that potential reusers can find them, how to convey context alongside, how to handle dependencies, how to communicate insights gained from reuse, or how the increased sharing affects the field's considerable environmental footprint. This talk will explore such opportunities and challenges &mdash; along with some potential solutions &mdash; based on profiling a set of practical examples.
