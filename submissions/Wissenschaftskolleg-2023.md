# Title

Enhanced participation as a key ingredient of an impactful research ecosystem equipped to tackle the complex problems of our times

# Abstract

Research processes are complex and take place at multiple levels, from individual researchers and research groups to research facilities, research fields and the research ecosystem as a whole. This talk explores multiple modes of participation in research processes at any such level and how they relate to the nature of research questions being addressed (or not) as well as to the impact that the resulting research methods, infrastructures, insights and other outcomes can have on the research ecosystem, its stakeholders and other facets of society. It touches upon ethical and sustainability aspects of the research system and highlights how collaborations across disciplinary, language, jurisdictional and other boundaries can enrich research by bringing together diverse perspectives, expertise, and resources. Featuring participatory elements itself, it further outlines how participation in research processes can be enhanced - both incrementally and in transformative fashions - to create impactful, innovative, and inclusive research environments better equipped to tackle the complex problems of our times.
