# About

This file assists in working out some sensible rules regarding when and how I am committing to meeting-free times, as per Resolution 2.viii in https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/blob/master/new-year-resolutions/2023.md .

> Experiment with meeting-free weeks ([perhaps quarterly](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-019-03953-y)) and with regular meeting-free days in between.

# Rules

## General rules
1. As long as the word "draft" remains in this first rule, these rules are to be considered a draft.
2. A "meeting" in this context is a planned event with two-way talk between me and one or more others for work purposes, with teaching excluded for now.
3. If other demands on my time come in for one of my planned meeting-free slots, I will strive to find a balance between the two, and use such concrete occasions to fine-tune these rules here.
4. I will set up a page explaining my meeting-free times, and point others to it as needed. This should include information on the general purposes of such arrangements (e.g. writing, coding, testing, planning, reading etc.) and over time also some concrete examples.
5. These meeting-free times are meant for days when I work, yet the idea of keeping them meeting-free covers the entire period, not just the official working part of it.
6. Once the rules are stable, consider integrating them with my [pledges](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/pledges).

## Rules specific to meeting-free weeks

1. There should be at least four per year.
2. There should be a theme defined a month in advance. 
3. There should be a schedule defined a week in advance.
5. There should be some public trace of what I did during that time, and perhaps also what I plan to do.

## Rules specific to meeting-free days outside meeting-free weeks

1. There should be at least one per month.
