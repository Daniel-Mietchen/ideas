# About

This file hosts my resolutions for 2022. The indicators ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´ stand for good/ intermediate/ bad progress, relative to the completion of the year.

# Resolutions

In 2021, I will strive to do the following:

1. [Operationalizing my values](#operationalization): Integrate my values more explicitly into my workflows.
1. [Documentation](#documentation): Document progress on at least a monthly basis.

# Operationalization

## Values

I will use my [pledges](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/pledges) as a starting point, trying to

1. make the values more explicit
1. establish closer links between my values and actions, especially prioritization (both active and passive) and decisions.


## Workflows

What I have in mind here are primarily my public workflows, i.e. mainly those related to research, education and humanitarian activities. A closer integration of my values with my non-public workflows is of interest too, but I will likely not comment on that in public.

# Documentation

The main issue here is not that I do not document but that I do so in various places. Most of these are public, so the main task is hence to take some time on a regular basis to add pointers here.


# Other ideas considered in drafting

* FAIRify my pledges
* [add two low-carbon habits](https://twitter.com/KHayhoe/status/1354124680978968576)
* Find a way to include vision statements by others (e.g. [by Kew Royal Botanic Gardens](http://web.archive.org/web/20210601021921/https://www.kew.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/RBG%20Kew%20Scientific%20Priorities%202021%20-%202030%20-%20May%202021.pdf)) on their scientific priorities in my resolutions and their implementation

* Go (entirely?) offline for at least six days in a row
* Join some more organizations whose missions are aligned with mine.
  - candidates: IGDORE, Sichere Videokonferenz
* Organize public online events on a regular basis, e.g. monthly, and ideally weave them together into a carpet that covers a structured set of themes.
* Do some concrete experimentation around ethical banking, as per [idea 969](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/969)
* Come up with a better system to decide which activities to stop in order to make room for taking up new ones
* Try to make more explicit connections to values when I am involved in decisions.
* When doing challenges, allow for a useful arrangement of breaks in between.
* Block certain periods of time for focus hours, perhaps with dedicated subsets for writing manuscripts or code and for reading and reviewing.
* Something offline
* Something outdoors
* Something related to SDGs, especially those with which I have not traditionally engaged much.
* Integrate documentation more closely into my workflows.
* Spend more time outdoors.
* Refine my scheduling to enhance focus hours.
* Streamline my handling of paperwork.
