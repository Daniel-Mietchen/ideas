# About

This file hosts my resolutions for 2022. All of this is to be considered a draft until 31 December 2021 finishes [anywhere on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth). The indicators ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´ stand for good/ intermediate/ bad progress, relative to the completion of the year.

# Resolutions

In 2021, I will strive to do the following:

1. Integrate my values more explicitly into my workflows.
1. Document progress on at least a monthly basis.

# Ideas

* FAIRify my pledges
* [add two low-carbon habits](https://twitter.com/KHayhoe/status/1354124680978968576)

* Join some more organizations whose missions are aligned with mine.
  - candidates: IGDORE, Sichere Videokonferenz
* Organize public online events on a regular basis, e.g. monthly, and ideally weave them together into a carpet that covers a structured set of themes.

* Come up with a better system to decide which activities to stop in order to make room for taking up new ones
* Try to make more explicit connections to values when I am involved in decisions.
* When doing challenges, allow for a useful arrangement of breaks in between.
* Block certain periods of time for focus hours, perhaps with dedicated subsets for writing manuscripts or code and for reading and reviewing.
* Something offline
* Something outdoors
* Something related to SDGs, especially those with which I have not traditionally engaged much.
* Integrate documentation more closely into my workflows.
* Spend more time outdoors.
* Refine my scheduling to enhance focus hours.
