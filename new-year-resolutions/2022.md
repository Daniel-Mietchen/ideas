# About

This file hosts my resolutions for 2022. The indicators ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´ stand for good/ intermediate/ bad progress, relative to the completion of the year.

# Resolutions

In 2021, I will strive to do the following:

1. [Operationalizing my values](#operationalization): Integrate my values more explicitly into my workflows.
  - J:ðŸŸ¡ F:ðŸŸ¡ M:ðŸŸ¡ A M J J A S O N D 
3. [Documentation](#documentation): Document progress on at least a monthly basis.
  - J:ðŸŸ¡ F:ðŸŸ¡ M:ðŸŸ¡ A M J J A S O N D 

# Operationalization

## Values

A list of values is in [this thread](https://web.archive.org/web/20220118023738/https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-valuable-things-everyone-should-know/answer/Jordan-B-Peterson), which has given rise to the book "[12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos ](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/)" which condesed values into this set of 12 rules:

1. Stand up straight with your shoulders back
1. Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping
1. Make friends with people who want the best for you
1. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today
1. Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them
1. Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world
1. Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient)
1. Tell the truth â€“ or, at least, don't lie
1. Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't
1. Be precise in your speech
1. Do not bother children when they are skateboarding
1. Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street


### My starting points

I will use my [pledges](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/pledges) as a starting point, trying to

1. make the values more explicit;
1. establish closer links between my values and actions, especially prioritization (both active and passive) and decisions;
1. take inspiration from others who have explored values in depth, e.g. [researchers publishing on values](https://scholia.toolforge.org/topic/Q194112), or [dying people looking back at their lives](https://web.archive.org/web/20200928042815/https://hard-wears.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Top-5-Regrets-of-the-Dying.pdf ), or [ethical licenses](https://ethicalsource.dev/licenses/).

### Confounding variables

There are various variables that interact with our values. For instance, the study [Why we eat what we eat. The Eating Motivation Survey (TEMS)](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q47874670) listed 15 of them in relation to eating habits (cf. their Table 3):
1. Liking
2. Habits
3. Need & Hunger
4. Health
5. Convenience
6. Pleasure
7. Traditional Eating
8. Natural Concerns
9. Sociability
10. Price
11. Visual Appeal
12. Weight Control
13. Affect Regulation
14. Social Norms
15. Social Image

* [Personal values in human life](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-017-0185-3)

## Workflows

What I have in mind here are primarily my public workflows, i.e. mainly those related to research, education and humanitarian activities. A closer integration of my values with my non-public workflows is of interest too, but I will likely not comment on that in public.

# Documentation

The main issue here is not that I do not document but that I do so in various places. Most of these are public, so the main task is hence to take some time on a regular basis to add pointers here.

* I curated the literature about ethical, social, cultural and personal values in Wikidata, to the point that the corresponding Scholia profiles are now too information-rich to be rendered properly, so that needs to be fixed.

# Other ideas considered in drafting

* FAIRify my pledges
* [add two low-carbon habits](https://twitter.com/KHayhoe/status/1354124680978968576)
* Find a way to include vision statements by others (e.g. [by Kew Royal Botanic Gardens](http://web.archive.org/web/20210601021921/https://www.kew.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/RBG%20Kew%20Scientific%20Priorities%202021%20-%202030%20-%20May%202021.pdf)) on their scientific priorities in my resolutions and their implementation
* integrate pledges I have signed into my [personal pledges](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/pledges)
* [Plan more concretely for when I'm gone](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/518)
* [Write next year's performance review now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3kNlFMXslo#t=5m53s)
* Go (entirely?) offline for at least six days in a row
* Join some more organizations whose missions are aligned with mine.
  - candidates: IGDORE, Sichere Videokonferenz
* Organize public online events on a regular basis, e.g. monthly, and ideally weave them together into a carpet that covers a structured set of themes.
* Do some concrete experimentation around ethical banking, as per [idea 969](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/969)
* Come up with a better system to decide which activities to stop in order to make room for taking up new ones
* Try to make more explicit connections to values when I am involved in decisions.
* When doing challenges, allow for a useful arrangement of breaks in between.
* Block certain periods of time for focus hours, perhaps with dedicated subsets for writing manuscripts or code and for reading and reviewing.
* Something offline
* Something outdoors
* Something related to SDGs, especially those with which I have not traditionally engaged much.
* Integrate documentation more closely into my workflows.
* Spend more time outdoors.
* Refine my scheduling to enhance focus hours.
* Streamline my handling of paperwork.
