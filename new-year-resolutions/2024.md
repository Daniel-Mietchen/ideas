# About 

This file hosts some draft ideas for my resolutions for 2024. The resolutions will come into effect once their draft status has been removed, which is to happen by 15 January 2024.

In 2024, I will strive to do the following (ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´ stand for good/ intermediate/ bad progress, relative to the completion of the year):

1. [Sustainability](#sustainability): explore ways to compare the different kinds of impact of my activities (e.g. environmental impact vs. open knowledge impact) and use that to inform decisions about what to take on/ continue/ change / stop;
2. [Communities](#communities): increase my engagement with communities aligned with my activities, especially around open science, Wikimedia, climate impact and biodiversity loss;
3. [Practice](#practice): engage in some X days of Y activities to learn and/ or to address open issues, and experiment with changing relevant routines;
4. [Workflows](#workflows): open up some additional parts of my workflows, e.g. for ticketing, scheduling, learning or social media;
5. [Documentation](#documentation): Provide monthly updates here on progress with respect to the above.
