# About 

This file hosts my resolutions for 2024. 

In 2024, I will strive to do the following (🟢/🟡/🔴 stand for good/ intermediate/ bad progress, relative to the completion of the year):

1. [Sustainability](#sustainability): explore ways to compare the different kinds of impact of my activities (e.g. environmental impact vs. open knowledge impact) and use that to inform decisions about what to take on/ continue/ change / stop;
2. [Communities](#communities): increase my engagement with communities aligned with my activities, especially around open science, Wikimedia, climate impact and biodiversity loss;
3. [Practice](#practice): engage in some X days of Y activities to learn and/ or to address open issues, and experiment with changing relevant routines;
4. [Workflows](#workflows): open up some additional parts of my workflows, e.g. for ticketing, scheduling, learning or social media;
5. [Documentation](#documentation): Provide monthly updates here on progress with respect to the above.

# Documentation

## Sustainability

🟢J🟢F🟢M🟢A🟢M🟢J🟢J🟢A🟢S🟢O🟢N🟢D

Here is a selection of relevant activities:
* I joined the [Zukunftsklage](https://zukunftsklage.greenpeace.de/), a lawsuit against the German government over its negligence of its obligations regarding effective climate policy.
* I joined the local energy collective [BürgerEnergie Jena](http://buergerenergie-jena.de/).
* I continued to engage with local meetups of [Parents for Future](https://www.parentsforfuture.de/de/) and [Scientists for Future](https://de.scientists4future.org/).
* I continued to engage in monthly [micro-lending via Kiva](https://www.kiva.org/lender/openscience).
* I attended parts of a [lecture series on sustainability](https://www.uni-jena.de/222200/ringvorlesung-nachhaltigkeit).
* I continued to wear my [climate tie](https://mastodon.social/@fizise@sigmoid.social/113509086016077172) at public events. It shows the [climate stripes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warming_stripes) and is a good catalyst of meaningful conversations on sustainability-related topics.
* I continued to document the biodiversity that I experienced. Some of that documentation then ends up [on iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?user_id=danielmietchen&verifiable=any&view=species) or [on Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rotfuchs_vor_Pavillonbauten_K%C3%B6nigin-Luise-Platz,_Altensteinstra%C3%9Fe_2-6,_K%C3%B6nigin-Luise-Stra%C3%9Fe_6-8,_Unter_den_Eichen_5-10,_Willdenowstra%C3%9Fe.jpg).
* 2024-12-18: The paper "[FAIR Jupyter: A Knowledge Graph Approach to Semantic Sharing and Granular Exploration of a Computational Notebook Reproducibility Dataset](https://doi.org/10.4230/TGDK.2.2.4)" is published &mdash; my second one that contains a carbon footprint estimate.
* 2024-11-23: I attended the [community conference](https://www.flow-projekt.de/images/Zsfg_Projektkonferenz2024_neu.pdf) of the [Flow project](https://www.flow-projekt.de/) for monitoring and restoration of small streams across Germany.
* 2024-09-26: Contributed to the session "[Transforming Knowledge into Practice: Science, Technology and Innovation in Support of the UN SDGs](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.10.e137763)" at the UN Science Summit. Also contributed to the [strategy meeting of the Wikimedians for Sustainable Development](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedians_for_Sustainable_Development/Meeting_minutes_20240915) earlier in the month.
* 2024-05-21: I participated in a [biodiversity science event for the public](https://www.fu-berlin.de/themen/biodiversitaet/schaukasten/science-picknick/index.html) ("Science Picknick") and gave a talk on "[Knowledge graphs: new perspectives on biodiversity](https://youtu.be/l2cYtCxipK4)" (in German).
* 2024-01-11: The paper "[Computational reproducibility of Jupyter notebooks from biomedical publications](https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giad113)" is published &mdash; my first one that contains a carbon footprint estimate.

🔴 I am still struggling with how the impact of all of this could be determined in a useful fashion, both in absolute terms and relative to the resources that were used on the way. Perhaps normalizing the [impact types tracked by IPBES](https://www.ipbes.net/impact-tracking-view) by resource use might be a useful starting point.

* I read "[Become a Caring Open Scientist](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2015.09.005)"
  - some quotes:
    - > Bringing care into this discussion has now moved us away from communities, cohorts, and institutions. Care directs us back to intentions that are articulated in culture, but which also speak to being human in a mutually responsible human environment: a phrase not usually descriptive of the academy. “[W]e are led to redefine responsibility as response-ability, the ability to respond positively to others and not just to fulfill assigned duties” (ibid).
    - > Open science is also science done through care and kindness: science that much more resembles the model of peer production within a commons, than it does a winner-take-all corporate struggle.

## Practice

🟢J🟢F🟢M🟢A🟢M🟢J🟢J🟢A🟢S🟢O🟢N🟢D

* 🟢 Language learning
  - Throughout January, I have been doing daily Duolingo lessons, mainly in Ukrainian. Unfortunately, that course is not very deep, so I finished it within about a month. I have still been practicing some Ukrainian on most days of the year, mainly through YouTube channels, science news, Wikimedia sites and Mastodon posts but also occasionally through Lingq.
  - Besides Ukrainian, I have [explored almost all languages](https://duome.eu/EvoMRI) Duolingo has on offer, and I found fun in challenging myself such that once I got a streak of error-free lessons in one language, I switched to another one.
  - I spent about two weeks in Italy in summer, and for that, I learned Italian to about A2/B1 level. Besides Duolingo, I used again Wikimedia sites, YouTube and science news as well as travel sites.
  - I don't like the way Duolingo tries to be addictive via gamification, so I frequently choose not to participate in those games. I also did 31 days straight without Duo lessons.
  - Most of the languages I would really like to engage with (Central Asian languages like Tajik, Uzbek, Kyrghyz, Kazakh, Uyghur, Karakalpak, Tatar, Urdu and others, European ones like Bulgarian or Albanian or indigenous ones from around the world) are neglected on Duo and similar apps, and I don't really want one app per language. 
* 🟡 Singing
  - I have been a member of the Central Asian folklore band [Tschiltan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GFU6L6qUMg) since 1999 and am still enjoying it whenever possible. While I miss most of the weekly rehearsals due to being out of town, I did participate in a concert performance in December.  
* 🟡 Programming
  - I have been working on and off on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) problems.
  - I have been exploring [Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/) since October and like what it has, though I would really like if they were to broaden the topics they cover. They too are using gamification but do not overdo it the way Duo does, and it is relatively easy to ignore.
* 🟡 Sports
  - I did have decent bouts of cycling, swimming, hiking and playing table tennis or soccer and even went to the gym for a while but overall, physical activity was not integrated enough into my daily routines.
* 🟢 Food 
  - I did one full month each without some of my favourite foods: mozzarella cheese, eggs and peanuts. For all three of them, I have had longer periods without them before, but those periods had essentially been accidental, while this time, they were planned.

## Workflows

🟢J🟢F🟢M🟢A🟢M🟢J🟢J🟢A🟢S🟢O🟢N🟢D

* I contributed to making computational reproducibility data about research-associated Jupyter notebooks more accessible for educational workflows ([paper](https://doi.org/10.4230/TGDK.2.2.4), [talk](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14191202)). 
* I ramped up my [use of Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@EvoMRI) throughout the year and [stopped using Twitter](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14019231).
* For scheduling polls, I consistently used the privacy-respecting [Dudel](https://dud-poll.inf.tu-dresden.de/) instead of more popular alternatives.
* I am working on simplifying the exploration of RDF knowledge graphs by non-technical users.
* I explored open LLMs but did not get too far with that.
* I am part of a team that is exploring [new workflows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Daniel_Mietchen/EICAT) for enriching Wikipedia infoboxes with information regarding the impact of non-native species.
* I have assisted others in sharing their research workflows.
