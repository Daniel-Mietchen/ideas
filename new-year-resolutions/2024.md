# About 

This file hosts some draft ideas for my resolutions for 2024. The resolutions will come into effect once their draft status has been removed, which is to happen by 15 January 2024.

# Ideas

## Procedural

* Perhaps have some goals set in stone and others to be picked from a list, as for 2023.

## Content

* Try to map to my long-term goals and pledges.
* Come up with a mechanism to compare the different kinds of impact of my activities (e.g. environmental impact vs. open knowledge impact)
* Make (and document) some efforts towards exploring alternatives to GitHub, especially [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/).
