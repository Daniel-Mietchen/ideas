# About 

This file hosts some draft ideas for my resolutions for 2024. 

In 2024, I will strive to do the following (🟢/🟡/🔴 stand for good/ intermediate/ bad progress, relative to the completion of the year):

1. [Sustainability](#sustainability): explore ways to compare the different kinds of impact of my activities (e.g. environmental impact vs. open knowledge impact) and use that to inform decisions about what to take on/ continue/ change / stop;
2. [Communities](#communities): increase my engagement with communities aligned with my activities, especially around open science, Wikimedia, climate impact and biodiversity loss;
3. [Practice](#practice): engage in some X days of Y activities to learn and/ or to address open issues, and experiment with changing relevant routines;
4. [Workflows](#workflows): open up some additional parts of my workflows, e.g. for ticketing, scheduling, learning or social media;
5. [Documentation](#documentation): Provide monthly updates here on progress with respect to the above.

# Documentation

## Sustainability

* 2024-01-11: The paper "[Computational reproducibility of Jupyter notebooks from biomedical publications](https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giad113)" is published &mdash; my first one that contains a carbon footprint estimate.

## Communities

* read "[Become a Caring Open Scientist](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2015.09.005)"
  - some quotes:
    - > Bringing care into this discussion has now moved us away from communities, cohorts, and institutions. Care directs us back to intentions that are articulated in culture, but which also speak to being human in a mutually responsible human environment: a phrase not usually descriptive of the academy. “[W]e are led to redefine responsibility as response-ability, the ability to respond positively to others and not just to fulfill assigned duties” (ibid).
    - > Open science is also science done through care and kindness: science that much more resembles the model of peer production within a commons, than it does a winner-take-all corporate struggle. 


## Practice

## Workflows


# Other ideas considered on the way

## Procedural

* Perhaps have some goals set in stone and others to be picked from a list, as for 2023.

## Content

* Find a useful way to engage with the "Permanent-Emergency Climate Science Code of Practice" proposed [here](https://medium.com/@JacksonDamian/faster-than-expected-9675203cf8ac) (copy [here](https://dgrnewsservice.org/civilization/ecocide/climate-change/are-climate-scientists-in-denial-about-climate-change/)).
* Try to map to my long-term goals and pledges.
  * Try to link this to "victories for humanity"
* Formally publish my pledges.
* Formally publish my scientific will.
* Come up with a mechanism to compare the different kinds of impact of my activities (e.g. environmental impact vs. open knowledge impact)
* Make (and document) some efforts towards exploring alternatives to GitHub, especially [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/).
* Increase community engagement around some of the things I care about, especially
  * Wikimedia science
  * RIO
  * sustainability
