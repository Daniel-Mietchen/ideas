# About

This file hosts my resolutions for the year 2023. See [here](https://github.com/users/Daniel-Mietchen/projects/1/views/1) for a drafty overview of the progress so far.

# Resolutions

Throughout 2023, I will

1. Do [365 climate edits](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedians_for_Sustainable_Development/365_climate_edits), i.e. at least one climate-related edit to a Wikimedia project every day. You can check my progress [here](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Daniel_Mietchen/365_climate_edits).
       - update April: 游릭 I am on track
1. Do at least 5 of the following
   1. [Draft my review of 2023 when it starts (by March 31 at the latest), then update on the go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3kNlFMXslo#t=5m53s). The basic idea here is to imagine what I want to (and realistically can) achieve by the end of the year, and then work my way backwards to manageable units of time and achievement that can be updated throughout the year. I have taken this approach a number of times when writing research proposals but not really practiced it in more personal contexts. So let's give this a try this year then.
       - update April: 游댮 I failed on this one &mdash; too many things around me are changing too quickly to plan ahead so much in a useful manner
   3. Come up with a process to derive my new year resolutions from specific issues, insights and other influences in a transparent way. 
       - update April: 游리 some progress, though not much to show yet 
   5. Come up with a process to assess progress with respect to the resolutions beyond the 游릭/游리/游댮 system I have used so far. Ideally, this would also work (perhaps with slight modifications) to communicate longer-term progress with respect to my [pledges](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/pledges). 
       - update April: 游리 some progress under the issue label [pledges](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Apledges)
   6. Experiment with machine-readable publication types, especially hypotheses, definitions, ethics statements and social pledges.
       - update April: 游리 some progress with nanopublications, which form the basis of the other publication types
   7. Take a close look at open-source hardware, and document my engagement with it.
       - update April: 游리 have lots more contacts now and a concrete project, yet not started hands-on work
   8. Take a close look at Twitter alternatives, and document my engagement with them.
       - update April: 游리 by now, my posting rate on Twitter has gone down considerably, and my Mastodon rates are at a similar order of magnitude
   9. Make more room for physical activity, e.g. commit to cycling at least as many km as there are hours with daylight over a certain period of time.
       - update April: 游리 I am cycling more regularly now, though not yet ver far
   10. Experiment with meeting-free weeks ([perhaps quarterly](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-019-03953-y)) and with regular meeting-free days in between.
       - update April: 游리 I had my first attempt at a meeting-free week, yet a few still snuck in, typically via some deadlines I had not been aware of while planning that week
   11. Come up with a system to address the many open issues in this repo more systematically. Perhaps via a 100-day sprint or some once-in-a week activity slot.
       - update April: 游댮 no real progress so far    
   12. Formalize my procedures for accepting new projects or responsibilities versus terminating or relinquishing existing ones.
       - update April: 游댮 no real progress here, just deeper recognition that this needs to be addressed
