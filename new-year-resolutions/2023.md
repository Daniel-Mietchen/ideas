# Resolutions

Throughout 2023, I will

1. Do [365 climate edits](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedians_for_Sustainable_Development/365_climate_edits), i.e. at least one climate-related edit to a Wikimedia project every day. You can check my progress [here](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Daniel_Mietchen/365_climate_edits).
1. Do at least 5 of the following
   1. [Draft my review of 2023 when it starts, then update on the go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3kNlFMXslo#t=5m53s). The basic idea here is to imagine what I want to (and realistically can) achieve by the end of the year, and then work my way backwards to manageable units of time and achievement that can be updated throughout the year. I have taken this approach a number of times when writing research proposals but not really practiced it in more personal contexts. So let's give this a try this year then.
   1. Come up with a process to derive my new year resolutions from specific issues, insights and other influences in a transparent way. 
   1. Come up with a process to assess progress with respect to the resolutions beyond the ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´ system I have used so far. Ideally, this would also work (perhaps with slight modifications) to communicate longer-term progress with respect to my [pledges](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/pledges). 
   1. Experiment with machine-readable publication types, especially hypotheses, definitions, ethics statements and social pledges.
   1. Take a close look at open-source hardware, and document my engagement with it.
   1. Take a close look at Twitter alternatives, and document my engagement with them.
   1. Make more room for physical activity, e.g. commit to cycling at least as many km as there are hours with daylight over a certain period of time.
   1. Experiment with meeting-free weeks ([perhaps quarterly](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-019-03953-y)) and with regular meeting-free days in between.
   1. Come up with a system to address the many open issues in this repo more systematically. Perhaps via a 100-day sprint or some once-in-a week activity slot.
   1. Formalize my procedures for accepting new projects or responsibilities versus terminating or relinquishing existing ones.
