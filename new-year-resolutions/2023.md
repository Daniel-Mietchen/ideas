# About

This file hosts my resolutions for the year 2023. See [here](https://github.com/users/Daniel-Mietchen/projects/1/views/1) for a drafty overview of the progress so far.

# Resolutions

Throughout 2023, I will

1. Do [365 climate edits](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedians_for_Sustainable_Development/365_climate_edits), i.e. at least one climate-related edit to a Wikimedia project every day. You can check my progress [here](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Daniel_Mietchen/365_climate_edits).
       - update Jan 1 2024: 游릭 Done
1. Do at least 5 of the following
   1. [Draft my review of 2023 when it starts (by March 31 at the latest), then update on the go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3kNlFMXslo#t=5m53s). The basic idea here is to imagine what I want to (and realistically can) achieve by the end of the year, and then work my way backwards to manageable units of time and achievement that can be updated throughout the year. I have taken this approach a number of times when writing research proposals but not really practiced it in more personal contexts. So let's give this a try this year then.
       - update Jan 1 2024: 游댮 I failed on this one &mdash; too many things around me are changing too quickly to plan ahead so much in a useful manner
   3. Come up with a process to derive my new year resolutions from specific issues, insights and other influences in a transparent way. 
       - update Jan 1 2024: 游리 some progress, though not much to show yet. I like the [victory for humanity](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/518#issuecomment-1869890449) approach
   5. Come up with a process to assess progress with respect to the resolutions beyond the 游릭/游리/游댮 system I have used so far. Ideally, this would also work (perhaps with slight modifications) to communicate longer-term progress with respect to my [pledges](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/pledges). 
       - update Jan 1 2024:
         - 游리 negligible progress under the issue label [pledges](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Apledges)
         - 游릭 progress regarding the 365 climate edits (see first resolution) was documented on a daily basis &mdash; probably best to adapt the documentation to the specific activity
   6. Experiment with machine-readable publication types, especially hypotheses, definitions, ethics statements and social pledges.
       - update Jan 1 2024: 游릭 some progress with [nanopublications]([url](https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.7.110725)), including as a basis of the other publication types
   7. Take a close look at open-source hardware, and document my engagement with it.
       - update Jan 1 2024: 游리 have lots more contacts now and a concrete project, including some hands-on work
   8. Take a close look at Twitter alternatives, and document my engagement with them.
       - update Jan 1 2024: 游릭 by now, my posting rate on Mastodon is well above that on Twitter but still much lower than what the Twitter one used to be
   9. Make more room for physical activity, e.g. commit to cycling at least as many km as there are hours with daylight over a certain period of time.
       - update Jan 1 2024: 游릭 I am cycling more regularly now, also going to the gym again
   10. Experiment with meeting-free weeks ([perhaps quarterly](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-019-03953-y)) and with regular meeting-free days in between.
       - update Jan 1 2024:
         - 游리 meeting-free weeks: I had one planned for each quarter, and by and large, it worked, but some meetings did sneak in
         - 游릭 meeting-free days: I tried to have one meeting-free day per week, and this worked in more than half of the cases
   11. Come up with a system to address the many open issues in this repo more systematically. Perhaps via a 100-day sprint or some once-in-a week activity slot.
       - update Jan 1 2024: 游댮 no real progress so far    
   12. Formalize my procedures for accepting new projects or responsibilities versus terminating or relinquishing existing ones.
       - update Jan 1 2024: 游댮 no real progress here, just deeper recognition that this needs to be addressed
