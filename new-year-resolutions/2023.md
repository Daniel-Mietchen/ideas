* [365 climate edits](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedians_for_Sustainable_Development/365_climate_edits)
* [Draft my review of 2023 when it starts, then update on the go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3kNlFMXslo#t=5m53s)
  - The basic idea here is to imagine what I want to (and realistically can) achieve by the end of the year, and then work my way backwards to manageable units of time and achievement that can be updated throughout the year. I have taken this approach a number of times when writing research proposal but not really practiced it in more personal contexts. So let's give this a try this year then.
* Come up with a process to derive my new year resolutions from specific issues, insights and other influences in a transparent way. 
* Come up with a process to assess progress beyond the ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´ system I have used so far.
* Take a close look at Twitter alternatives.
* Publish my [pledges](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/pledges) in a formal way.
* Make more room for physical activity
