# Inspirational quote

> To live is to choose. But to choose well, you must know who you are, what you stand for, where you want to go and why you want to get there.

The earliest record that I found for this is [Kofi Annan's commencement speech at MIT in 1997](https://news.mit.edu/1997/annansp), but it has been [copied all over the web](https://www.ecosia.org/search?q=To+live+is+to+choose.+But+to+choose+well%2C+you+must+know+who+you+are%2C+what+you+stand+for%2C+where+you+want+to+go+and+why+you+want+to+get+there.), and I cannot exclude that earlier versions (possibly by others) might exist.

# Review all of my major professional, volunteer and family activities from the perspective of their sustainability

*In this context, I am considering to use the [Resilience/ Relinquishment/ Restauration framework by Jem Bendell](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/datascience/blob/master/cinema.md). Note: dates are approximate, as I am active across multiple time zones.*

## Motivation

The following quote is from the first paragraph of an [article about climate tipping points](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-019-03595-0), and I have highlighted how it relates to biophysics, the field I was trained in:
> Politicians, economists and even some natural scientists have tended to assume that tipping points in the Earth system â€” such as the loss of the Amazon rainforest or the West Antarctic ice sheet â€” are of low probability and little understood. Yet evidence is mounting that these events could be more likely than was thought, have high impacts and are interconnected across different **biophysical systems**, potentially committing the world to long-term irreversible changes.

## Generic notes

*Here, I will list things relevant to all three parts of "professional, volunteer and family".*

* I have abandoned 
  - [flights to destinations where I would spend less than a month.](https://noflyclimatesci.org/biographies/daniel-mietchen)
  - [flights under 1000km](https://unter1000.scientists4future.org/signatures/)
  - eating meat or fish
  - using fossil-based electricity at home
* What I have in mind in terms of prioritizing sustainability-directed action this year is nicely framed in the blog post [How to bend the climate curve in 2020](https://www.monkeywrench.org.uk/blog/2020/2/4/how-to-bend-the-climate-curve-in-2020) that also links to a closely related scholarly article, [Social tipping dynamics for stabilizing Earthâ€™s climate by 2050](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1900577117). The following figure (licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en)) from there highlights some social tipping interventions that have a potential to help mitigate climate change.
[![Social tipping elements (STEs) and associated social tipping interventions (STIs) with the potential to drive rapid decarbonization in the Worldâ€“Earth system.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Social_tipping_dynamics_for_stabilizing_Earth%E2%80%99s_climate_by_2050_-_Figure_3_-_Social_tipping_elements_and_associated_social_tipping_interventions_with_the_potential_to_drive_rapid_decarbonization_in_the_World%E2%80%93Earth_system.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Social_tipping_dynamics_for_stabilizing_Earth%E2%80%99s_climate_by_2050_-_Figure_3_-_Social_tipping_elements_and_associated_social_tipping_interventions_with_the_potential_to_drive_rapid_decarbonization_in_the_World%E2%80%93Earth_system.jpg)
* One challenge I have come across when reviewing the environmental footprint of behaviours I am engaged in is that many of them are hard for me to quantify, and contexts or insights where such quantification has been attempted in the past are often not easily transferable to my situation. A [literature review](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q58311226) on the matter reached a similar conclusion:
  * > "Overall, emissions reductions observed through behavioural interventions to date are promising, yet much smaller than the scope and scale necessary to meet international climate targets. Further research that focuses on rigorously quantifying the emissions reductions achieved from ambitious, effective, and/or highly feasible interventions is urgently needed to inform the design and implementation of interventions that will be sufficient to avoid dangerous climate change."
  * A [summary](https://twitter.com/PaulEDawson/status/1287734230936518661) that resonated with me:
    - > No matter how uncomfortable and unprofitable that may be.
    - > We must change almost everything in our current societies.
    - > The bigger your carbon footprint  â€“  the bigger your moral duty.
    - > The bigger your platform  â€“  the bigger your responsibility.
  * in any case, [here](https://www.klimareporter.de/tag/serie-kippelemente) is a nice introductory series of posts on the individual natural tipping elements
* There are many lists with things you could do to live more sustainably. I liked the tone of [this one](https://www.wearepossible.org/actions-blog/ten-things-you-can-do-right-now-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis) and the consideration of what we should stop doing (Bendell's "relinquishment").

### Reading lists

* I have long reading lists in mutliple places already, so I will try to keep this one short and crisp and prioritize it over the others:

  - [Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World â€“ and Why Things Are Better Than You Think](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factfulness:_Ten_Reasons_We%27re_Wrong_About_the_World_%E2%80%93_and_Why_Things_Are_Better_Than_You_Think)
  - [The Great Mindshift](http://greatmindshift.org/)
  - [The Open Revolution - Rewriting the rules of the information age](https://openrevolution.net/)
  - [Reducing foodâ€™s environmental impacts through producers and consumers](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaq0216)
  - [Generous Thinking](https://generousthinking.hcommons.org/)
  - [Towards a Dynamic Multiscale Personal Information Space](https://madebyafox.github.io/Human-Centered-Information-Spaces/docs/CCS_2020.pdf)
  - [A Philosophy of Software Design](https://www.andybutland.dev/2020/01/thoughts-on-philosophy-of-software-design.html)
    - > The class is taught in a fashion similar to a traditional English writing class. In an English class, students use an iterative process where they write a draft, get feedback, and then rewrite to make improvements.

## Professional and volunteer
*I will likely keep these two together for now, since they have a strong overlap.*

* 2020-10-16: I submitted my [thoughts](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/blob/master/sustainability/Global-Call-for-Priorities-for-Science-2020.md) on "the most critical priority to be addressed in the coming decade in order for science to support and enable societies to achieve the SDGs"
* 2020-10-09: I initiated an annual donation to The Guardian based on their [climate pledge](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/oct/16/the-guardians-climate-pledge-2019) and the [2020 progress report about it](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2020/oct/05/the-guardian-climate-pledge-2020-environment-emergency-carbon-emissions?INTCMP=enviro_moment_2020_epic)

* 2020-09-25: I signed the [Open letter and demands to EU and global leaders](https://climateemergencyeu.org/)
* 2020-09-22: I signed the Open letter "Make green recovery a reality â€” make the Paris Agreement a reality" that is to be sent to European decision makers (Heads of States, European Commission, European Parliament) on September 30 (not public yet)
* 2020-09-16: A team that I was part of submitted a manuscript [Representing COVID-19 information in collaborative knowledge graphs: a study of Wikidata](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4033382)
* 2020-09-04: I signed the petition [Actions on Climate Emergency](https://europa.eu/citizens-initiative/initiatives/details/2019/000015_en), which "call[s] on the European Commission to strengthen action on the climate emergency in line with the 1.5Â° warming limit."

* 2020-08-28-2020-09-03: I participated in a [Climate Reality Leadership Global Training](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/blob/master/Summer-2020-Climate-Reality-Leadership-Corps-Global-Training.md)
* 2020-08-20: I attended the Workshop "[Data Science in Climate and Climate Impact Research](https://wcr.ethz.ch/news-and-events/events/workshop--data-science-in-climate-and-climate-impact-research-.html)" taking place on 20-21 August 2020 in Zurich and online and was involved in two presentations there: 
  * Sarasua, Cristina, & Mietchen, Daniel. (2020, August). Multilingual Structured Climate Research Data in Wikidata - The Community Perspective. Zenodo. [http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3994272](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3994272)
  * Mietchen, Daniel, & Sarasua, Cristina. (2020, August). Multilingual Structured Climate Research Data in Wikidata - The Data Perspective. Zenodo. [http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3994266](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3994266) (also [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntI6hmT-rRc))
* 2020-08-05: I signed the [Data Values and Principles](https://datapractices.org/manifesto/)
* 2020-08-04: I listened to the podcast [Greta Thunberg: Humanity has not yet failed](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7E2Wz3C5XwtEw3Pi96tLQA?si=I3je3yw7QGOFaWU_fTorpQ), in which she lays out in 12 "chapters" (taken from her diary) her experiences from the time she went ashore in Manhattan until the COVID-19 lockdowns
  - I only listened and did not take notes but found it very powerful and will recommend it to others.
  - A transcript is available via [TIME Magazine](https://time.com/5863684/greta-thunberg-diary-climate-crisis/)
  - One passsage that resonated with me in particular is when she turned around the question of "What shall we do about the climate emergency?" to "What should we stop doing in light of the climate emergency?"
* 2020-08-02: I considered becoming a member of [Klimawissen e.V.](https://www.verein-klimawissen.de/) but according to [their bylaws](https://www.verein-klimawissen.de/images/Satzung-17_07_2018.pdf) (Â§ 4 &mdash; Erwerb der Mitgliedschaft), people other than the founding members can only become a member if supported by more then 3/4 of the votes on the matter at a general assembly. It is not clear who the current members are or what the dates are/ were for the most recent or the next annual assembly, or where to find protocols from such meetings. This means that I won't become a member any time soon, but I pinged them on these issues.
* 2020-07-22: I [signed](https://twitter.com/EvoMRI/status/1285922662930354178) the [Cercedilla manifesto: Research meetings must be more sustainable](https://www.openpetition.eu/petition/online/cercedilla-manifesto-research-meetings-must-be-more-sustainable), leaving the following comment:
  - > For the first conference that I helped organize (Eurodoc 2005 in Strasbourg), we tried to follow such sustainability principles, but ultimately missed the targets in several dimensions. So I know it is hard, but in all later events I was involved in, I tried to push things further towards sustainability and was pleased to notice that more and more others got interested in these matters. With the COVID-19 pandemic having paused most in-person meetings and stimulated experimentation with online formats or combinations of online and in-person activities, I think now is the right time to push for systemic changes in the way large-scale meetings are organized, and the principles outlined here for organizers and attendees are a very good starting point. I'd be most happy to join forces with other signees in order to move this forward.
* 2020-07-16: I [signed](https://twitter.com/EvoMRI/status/1283886987989135360) an [Open letter and demands to EU and Global Leaders](https://climateemergencyeu.org/), which outlines demands for concrete climate action by EU leaders
* 2020-07-16: I [signed](https://twitter.com/EvoMRI/status/1283876363628404737) (Signature identifier: de3241153097) [https://www.stopglobalwarming.eu/](https://www.stopglobalwarming.eu/), a petition that calls on the EU to add a price tag to CO2 emissions
  - this has since been moved to the [European Citizensâ€™ initiative](https://eci.fridaysforfuture.org/en/).
* 2020-06-30: A team that I was part of published the [The final version of the RDA COVID-19 Recommendations and Guidelines for Data Sharing](https://doi.org/10.15497/rda00052)
* 2020-06-27: I [donated](https://twitter.com/EvoMRI/status/1276960552049414146) to the [crowdfunding campaign for a 1.5Â°C climate law in Germany](https://www.startnext.com/klimagesetz) ([English summary](https://www.germanzero.de/english-summary))
  - that campaign reached its initial funding goal of 300k Euros
  - see also [campaign video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9cn1KBakpw)
* 2020-06-27: I signed a [petition](https://www.gruene.de/artikel/7-punkte-plan-zur-verbesserung-der-lage-in-den-schlachth%C3%B6fen) for reforming the political framework for the meat industry in Germany, outlining seven steps towards improving the situation in slaughterhouses, with a focus on working conditions and some remarks on animal welfare and environmental impact
* 2020-06-18: I submitted a [Request To Join A Climate Reality Leadership Corps: Global Training](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/blob/master/July-2020-Climate-Reality-Leadership-Corps-Global-Training.md)
* 2020-05-27: The grant proposal [Quantifying the Impact of Data Sharing on Outbreak Dynamics (QIDSOD)](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.6.e54770) that I co-wrote was published

* 2020-03-13: The [Wikimedians for Sustainable Development](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedians_for_Sustainable_Development) that I have helped form was [recognized](https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affiliations_Committee/Resolutions/Recognition_of_Wikimedians_for_Sustainable_Development&oldid=19891181) as a Wikimedia User Group
* 2020-02-19 (ca.): I signed ([as signatory 3645](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3685632)) the [Scientists' Statement on the EU's Common Agricultural Policy](https://doi.org/10.1002/pan3.10080)

- 2020-01-04: I signed (as signatory number 331) the [petition for the UN Security Council to declare a Climate Emergency](https://www.now.world/global_climate_emergency)
  - as of 2020-08-02, the petition has 3,118 signatures, which is a rather low number for this kind of effort, and even short of their target of 5,000
- 2020-01-03: I responded to the [call](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/get-involved) to get involved in the [UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/)

## Family

*I will likely keep most of this private but will strive to share bits and pieces when appropriate.*

Things I am considering:
 - ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ´ [plant trees](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/1267)
   - e.g. plant a tree at every birthday of someone in my family
     - looks like there is a hashtag for that already: [#birthdaytrees](https://twitter.com/search?q=birthdaytrees)
   - challenge: I don't own any real estate anywhere, so not sure where to plant these trees
   - I am digging deeper into various tree-related topics, e.g.
     - the role of forests versus soils
     - managed versus natural forests
       - [Lasst den Wald in Ruhe!](https://www.ardaudiothek.de/synapsen-ein-wissenschaftspodcast/7-lasst-den-wald-in-ruhe/77135348) (podcast "Leave the forest alone!")
     - laminated timber versus concrete as structural material in buildings
   - 2020-10-16: I [signed up](https://twitter.com/EvoMRI/status/1317170346529902593) for a [TreeCard](https://www.treecard.org/), a debit card where "80% of profits go straight to reforestation". They said that they would plant 3 trees for every registrant.
   - 2020-11-04: My Hacktoberfest tree ([background](https://web.archive.org/web/20201120200815/https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details)) has been planted, for which they have this badge: [![](http://web.archive.org/web/20201104160324if_/https://anchor.digitalocean.com/rs/113-DTN-266/images/Tree%20Badge.png)](http://web.archive.org/web/20201104160324if_/https://anchor.digitalocean.com/rs/113-DTN-266/images/Tree%20Badge.png)
     - [Through that](https://tree-nation.com/profile/digitalocean) and [tweets](https://twitter.com/katjaQheuer/status/1328307276466237442) [about it](https://twitter.com/kdambekalns/status/1328259917359296512), I became aware of [Tree Nation](https://tree-nation.com/)  
   - 2020-11-20: I participated in the [tree planting initiative](http://web.archive.org/web/20201120202823/http://web.archive.org/screenshot/https://www.gerolsteiner.de/de/gerolsteiner-brunnen/nachhaltigkeit-umwelt/baumpflanzaktion/) of a company that sells mineral water
     - I chose an *Acer pseudoplatanus* (Bergahorn, sycamore)
   - 2020-11-25: I donated to Ecosia to [plant 20 trees](https://plant.ecosia.org/collections/trees).
     - [Through that](https://twitter.com/wickesgirl/status/1326612502369677314), I became aware of [Trees for Cities](https://www.treesforcities.org/)
 - plant seeds, e.g.
   - [Open Source Seeds](https://opensourceseeds.org/en/home)
   - [Saatgutkonfetti](https://www.startnext.com/saatgutkonfetti)
     - I contacted [Saatgutkonfetti.de](https://saatgutkonfetti.de/) about the [Open Source Seeds licence](https://www.opensourceseeds.org/en/license1)
       - pinged them again a week later
 - including the ecological footprint of food components more systematically into meal planning
   - e.g. as per [Ã–kologische FuÃŸabdrÃ¼cke von Lebensmitteln und Gerichten in Deutschland](https://web.archive.org/web/20201101004045/https://www.ifeu.de/wp-content/uploads/Reinhardt-Gaertner-Wagner-2020-Oekologische-Fu%C3%9Fabdruecke-von-Lebensmitteln-und-Gerichten-in-Deutschland-ifeu-2020.pdf) or [Klimatarier](https://www.klimatarier.com/de/CO2_Rechner)

# Formalize my pledges

As per https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/736 .
I have now set up https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/pledges for this purpose. I was approaching this pretty seriously so far, but [here](https://twitter.com/threadreaderapp/status/1225469483432783872) is a more humorous angle as well for good measure.

# Finish at least one 100 day challenge before the end of the year

ðŸŸ¢ **Update 21 September 2020: I [started](https://twitter.com/EvoMRI/status/1308172566029307904).** For progress, see [notebooks](https://public.paws.wmcloud.org/12410844/100days/?C=N&O=D) or [tweets](https://twitter.com/search?q=100DaysOfJupyter&f=live).

*The notes below in this section are mostly out of date now but kept for archival purposes.*

As per [100 day challenge](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/learning2code/blob/master/100days/100days.md). 
- relevant options:
  - [100daysofcode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofcode) OR [100daysofpython](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofpython) OR [100daysofdata](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofdata) OR [100wikidatadays](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100wikidatadays).
    - For Wikidata, some inspiration is in "SPARQL query of the day" threads, e.g. by [Wikidata India](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_India/Queries) ([sample tweet](https://twitter.com/LearningSPARQL/status/1191072279058374656))
- ideally, do that under a sustainability theme
- good starting point: https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions

Some advice on new year resolutions for developers is offered [via Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/developer-new-years-resolution-guide/) &mdash; a platform that I was aware of but have not really [looked into](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/1268) yet.

Still via Free Code Camp (in this case [its founder](https://twitter.com/ossia/status/1213197836021587968)), I saw [this nice post about a 100days challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-i-built-100-projects-in-100-days/). The developer who undertook that challenge is also doing some live coding, and I might consider watching some live coding (probably [in Python](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=live+coding+python)) too.

On the practicalities of 100 day challenges, I have been using Duolingo as a testbed, allowing for the use of what they call Streak freezes. I very much disliked their Leagues system (which is meant to encourage learning but designed too intrusively in my view) and thus stopped using the platform after some 70 days &mdash; progress till then can be seen [here](https://duome.eu/EvoMRI). I am also experimenting with doing daily doses of [CodeCombat](https://codecombat.com/play) and [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic makes it hard to plan anything for the near future, though, so doing something for 100 days in a row might not actually be feasible, and I plan to make provisions for that.


# Definitely stop using at least two non-open communication channels like Slack, Trello, Twitter or Skype by the end of the year

* Nice quote from Clay Shirky:
  - > [When you adopt a tool, you also adopt the management philosophy embedded in that tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEN4XNth61o#t=8m9s)
* The reasons for cutting down on the number of communication apps are nicely laid out in [this post](https://usefyi.com/the-new-silos/). The solution it proposes, though, is essentially just another closed app, even though they are touting it as "not yet another app trying to be your single source of truth" and "a glue, a connective layer between all of the apps your company uses". 
* ðŸ”´ Early in the year, I actually re-started using Slack in order to help with the international organization of Scientists for Future. 
* ðŸŸ¢ Also early in the year, I started using [Telegram](https://telegram.org/), which is used widely in Wikimedia contexts.
* ðŸŸ¢ 2020-09-08: Installed [Signal](https://signal.org/), which is [open-source](https://github.com/signalapp) and [privacy-minded](https://signal.org/).
* ðŸŸ¢ In several cases, I refused requests to join groups on Whatsapp/Facebook (which I have both never used) and Trello (which I did occasionally use in the past).
* ðŸ”´ 2020-10-27 I participated in two conferences (Neuromatch 3.0 and Beilstein Open Science Symposium 2020) which essentially forced attendees &mdash; at least presenters like me &mdash; into closed conferencing systems ([StackField](https://www.stackfield.com) for the latter and something apparently homegrown by the former). I [made a note about that](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/commit/4d9644eedcb3cbe01a78e83549c11c1f0b3d9917) for next year's resolutions.

# Provide monthly updates here on progress with respect to the above

I will try to do that by updating this file regularly (i.e. more than once per month). See [its version history](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/commits/master/new-year-resolutions) for details.

# Outlook

In the long run, I think I will emphasize long-term pledges, review progress with respect to them on an annual basis, and select pledges for the new year as concrete steps &mdash; achievable within a year &mdash; towards implementing what I have pledged for.
