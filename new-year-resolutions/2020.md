# Overview
In 2020, I will strive to do the following:

1. [Sustainability review](#review-all-of-my-major-professional-volunteer-and-family-activities-from-the-perspective-of-their-sustainability): Review all of my major professional, volunteer and family activities from the perspective of their sustainability;

1. [Skills](#finish-at-least-one-of-100daysofcode-or-100daysofpython-or-100daysofdata-or-100wikidatadays-before-the-end-of-the-year): Finish at least one of [100daysofcode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofcode) OR [100daysofpython](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofpython) OR [100daysofdata](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofdata) OR [100wikidatadays](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100wikidatadays) before the end of the year;
1. [Workflows](#definitely-stop-using-at-least-two-non-open-communication-channels-like-slack-trello-twitter-or-skype-by-the-end-of-the-year): Definitely stop using at least two non-open communication channels like Slack, Trello, Twitter or Skype by the end of the year;

# Review all of my major professional, volunteer and family activities from the perspective of their sustainability

*In this context, I am considering to use the [Resilience/ Relinquishment/ Restauration framework by Jem Bendell](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/datascience/blob/master/cinema.md).*

## Professional and volunteer
*I will likely keep these two together for now, since they have a strong overlap.*

- I responded to the [call](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/get-involved) to get involved in the [UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/)

## Family

*I will likely keep most of this private but will strive to share bits and pieces when appropriate.*

Things I am considering:
 - [plant trees](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/1267)
   - e.g. plant a tree at every birthday of someone in my family
   - challenge: I don't own any real estate anywhere, so not sure where to plant these trees

# Formalize my pledges

As per https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/736

# Finish at least one of 100daysofcode OR 100daysofpython OR 100daysofdata OR 100wikidatadays before the end of the year

As per [100daysofcode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofcode) OR [100daysofpython](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofpython) OR [100daysofdata](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofdata) OR [100wikidatadays](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100wikidatadays).
  - ideally, do that under a sustainability theme

Some advice on new year resolutions for developers is offered [via Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/developer-new-years-resolution-guide/) &mdash; a platform that I was aware of but have not really [looked into](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/1268) yet.

# Definitely stop using at least two non-open communication channels like Slack, Trello, Twitter or Skype by the end of the year

I actually re-started using Slack in order to help with the international organization of Scientists for Future.

# Provide monthly updates here on progress with respect to the above

I will try to do that by updating this file regularly (i.e. more than once per month).
