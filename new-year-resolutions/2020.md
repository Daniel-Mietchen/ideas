# Overview
In 2020, I will strive to do the following:

1. Review all of my major professional, volunteer and family activities from the perspective of their sustainability;
1. [Formalize my pledges](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/736);
1. Finish at least one of [100daysofcode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofcode) OR [100daysofpython](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofpython) OR [100daysofdata](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofdata) OR [100wikidatadays](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100wikidatadays) before the end of the year;
1. Definitely stop using at least two non-open communication channels like Slack, Trello, Twitter or Skype by the end of the year;
1. Provide monthly updates here on progress with respect to the above.


# Review all of my major professional, volunteer and family activities from the perspective of their sustainability

## Professional and volunteer
*I will likely keep these two together for now, since they have a strong overlap*

- I responded to the [call](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/get-involved) to get involved in the [UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/)

## Family

*I will likely keep most of this private but will strive to share bits and pieces when appropriate.*

# Formalize my pledges

As per https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/736

# Finish at least one of 100daysofcode OR 100daysofpython OR 100daysofdata OR 100wikidatadays before the end of the year

As per [100daysofcode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofcode) OR [100daysofpython](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofpython) OR [100daysofdata](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofdata) OR [100wikidatadays](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100wikidatadays)

# Definitely stop using at least two non-open communication channels like Slack, Trello, Twitter or Skype by the end of the year

I actually re-started using Slack in order to help with the international organization of Scientists for Future.

# Provide monthly updates here on progress with respect to the above

I will try to do that by updating this file regularly (i.e. more than once per month).
