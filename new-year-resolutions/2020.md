# Review all of my major professional, volunteer and family activities from the perspective of their sustainability

*In this context, I am considering to use the [Resilience/ Relinquishment/ Restauration framework by Jem Bendell](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/datascience/blob/master/cinema.md). Note: dates are approximate, as I am active across multiple time zones.*

## Generic

*Here, I will list things relevant to all three parts of "professional, volunteer and family".*

* [I have abandoned flights to destinations where I would spend less than a month.](https://noflyclimatesci.org/biographies/daniel-mietchen)

## Professional and volunteer
*I will likely keep these two together for now, since they have a strong overlap.*

- 2020-01-04: I signed (as signatory number 331) the [petition for the UN Security Council to declare a Climate Emergency](https://www.now.world/global_climate_emergency)
- 2020-01-03: I responded to the [call](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/get-involved) to get involved in the [UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/)
- 2020-01-01: I [responded](https://twitter.com/EvoMRI/status/1212213688465268736) to the [UN's 75th anniversary public consultation](https://un75.online/)

## Family

*I will likely keep most of this private but will strive to share bits and pieces when appropriate.*

Things I am considering:
 - [plant trees](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/1267)
   - e.g. plant a tree at every birthday of someone in my family
   - challenge: I don't own any real estate anywhere, so not sure where to plant these trees

# Formalize my pledges

As per https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/736 .
I have now set up https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/pledges for this purpose.

# Finish at least one 100 day challenge before the end of the year

As per [100 day challenge](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/learning2code/blob/master/100days.md). 
- relevant options:
  - [100daysofcode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofcode) OR [100daysofpython](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofpython) OR [100daysofdata](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofdata) OR [100wikidatadays](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100wikidatadays).
    - For Wikidata, some inspiration is in "SPARQL query of the day" threads, e.g. by [Wikidata India](https://twitter.com/LearningSPARQL/status/1191072279058374656)
- ideally, do that under a sustainability theme

Some advice on new year resolutions for developers is offered [via Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/developer-new-years-resolution-guide/) &mdash; a platform that I was aware of but have not really [looked into](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/1268) yet.

Still via Free Code Camp (in this case [its founder](https://twitter.com/ossia/status/1213197836021587968)), I saw [this nice post about a 100days challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-i-built-100-projects-in-100-days/). The developer who undertook that challenge is also doing some live coding, and I might consider watching some live coding (probably [in Python](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=live+coding+python)) too.

# Definitely stop using at least two non-open communication channels like Slack, Trello, Twitter or Skype by the end of the year

I actually re-started using Slack in order to help with the international organization of Scientists for Future.

# Provide monthly updates here on progress with respect to the above

I will try to do that by updating this file regularly (i.e. more than once per month).

# Outlook

In the long run, I think I will emphasize long-term pledges, review progress with respect to them on an annual basis, and select pledges for the new year as concrete steps &mdash; achievable within a year &mdash; towards implementing what I have pledged for.
