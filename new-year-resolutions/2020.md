In 2020, I will strive to do the following:

1. Review all of my major professional, volunteer and family activities from the perspective of their sustainability;
1. [Formalize my pledges](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/736);
1. Finish at least one of [100daysofcode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofcode) OR [100daysofpython](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofpython) OR [100daysofdata](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofdata) OR [100wikidatadays](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100wikidatadays) before the end of the year;
1. Definitely stop using at least two non-open communication channels like Slack, Trello, Twitter or Skype by the end of the year.
1. Provide monthly updates here on progress with respect to the above.
