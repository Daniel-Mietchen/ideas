# About 

This file hosts some draft ideas for my resolutions for 2025. The ones from [2024](2024.md) worked out reasonably well, so this year's are building on them. The main change is that I removed sustainability as a stand-alone item because I will increase my efforts to address sustainability in everything I am involved with. 

# The plan

In 2025, I will strive to do the following (🟢/🟡/🔴 stand for good/ intermediate/ bad progress, relative to the completion of the year):

1. [Communities](#communities): keep more detailed track of my engagement with [communities](../communities/communities.md), consider my potential kinds and levels of engagement with them and alignment by [values](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/pledges), assess relevant impacts and on that basis explore systemic improvements &mdash; both within and across communities &mdash; towards more open knowledge sharing, lower environmental footprint and greater overall sustainability;
2. [Workflows](#workflows): check my own workflows for dependencies in more detail and explore ways to contribute to their respective sustainability or to switch to more sustainable ones;
3. [Practice](#practice): engage in a series of specific periods of targeted activities to learn and/ or to explore meaningful change, particularly in view of a lifestyle that is both healthy and sustainable;
4. [Documentation](#documentation): provide monthly updates here on progress with respect to the above, paying special attention to sustainability aspects.

# Documentation

Let's see how these ideas pan out over the course of the year. 

## Communities 

* [communities.md](../communities/communities.md)
  * 🟢 [January](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/blob/a474fcf57d07b807f91915068a8da6fb3d348698/communities/communities.md): 18 entries in table

  * 🟢 I continued to update the file on a roughly monthly basis throughout the year.
* [events.md](../communities/events.md)
  * 🟢 2025-01-14: started the file to keep track of events I am planning to attend.
  * 🟢 [January](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/blob/fe41fdcf5b521ac0976949356a2080343ce48834/communities/events.md): 30 events listed

  * 🟢 I continued to update the file on a roughly monthly basis throughout the year.

## Workflows

* January:
  * 🟢 started experimenting with using [BigBlueButton](https://bbb.wikipedia.de/) systematically for videoconferences.
  * 🟢 started experimenting with using [DFN Terminplaner](https://terminplaner6.dfn.de) systematically for scheduling polls, as a complement to [Dudel](https://dud-poll.inf.tu-dresden.de/).
* February: 🔴 no relevant activity
* March 🟢:
  * I am considering to stop supporting petitions run via change.org ([example](https://www.change.org/p/stopp-gro%C3%9Fe-baumf%C3%A4llung-in-jena-zwischen-volksbad-und-volkshochschule)) for its lack of transparency regarding data protection and funding streams.
  * I am looking into using [FairEmail](https://email.faircode.eu/) and also considering [European alternatives to US-based services](https://european-alternatives.eu/).
  * I am looking into [fairmeeting](https://fairmeeting.net/) as another option for videoconferences.
  * I got in touch with [Local-IT e.V.](https://local-it.org/) who provide community support for open-source workflows.
* April 🟢:
  * Looked into [Nuudel](https://nuudel.digitalcourage.de/) as an alternative to DFN Terminplaner and Dudel (see above)
  * Participated in the [April 2025 Scholia Hackathon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Scholia/Events/2025_04) that is part of a series of events aimed at running Scholia on a more sustainable infrastructure
* 🟢 The transition of Scholia's backend formed the focus of much of my workflow-related activities for the rest of the year, including through additional hackathons in [November](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Scholia/Events/2025_11) and [December](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Scholia/Events/2025_12).
* May: 🟢 Joined the [SeDOA](https://diamond-open-access.de/en/sedoa/) project that aims to provide meaningful support to Diamond Open Access initiatives in Germany. My role in there is focused on improving DOA workflows, with a special attention to sustainability.
* July: 🟢 Submitted a computer science [proposal](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.11.e171656) that has a dedicated sustainability workpackage 
* August 🟢: started to systematically engage with the nanopublications community through the [nanopublication-Enhanced Open Science Communication (nEOSC)](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/neosc) project. 
* September:
  * 🟢 started to contribute to the organization of the [SEMANTiCS 2026](https://2026-eu.semantics.cc/) conference, serving as chair for sustainability matters
  * 🟢 started to explore [Cryptpad](https://cryptpad.org/) as an open-source platform for online collaboration.
* November: 🟢 started beta-testing the new version of the ARPHA platform, hopefully to be released soon

## Practice
* 🟡 Throughout Q1, I am using [The Daily Dozen](https://nutritionfacts.org/daily-dozen/).
  * 🟢 January average: 12
  * 🟢 February average: 14
* 🟡 Throughout Q1, I am recording my steps, aiming to reach a monthly average of at least 300,000, i.e. about 10,000 per day.
  * 🟢 2025-01-28: 300k steps for January reached
  * 🟢 2025-02-28: 300k steps for February reached  
  * 🟢 2025-03-28: 300k steps for March reached
  * Beyond Q1, I keep recording my steps, but not with an explicit goal. The 300k step mark was not reached in April but in May (on the 31st) and June (on the 28th).
* 🟡 By Q3, I plan to upload at least one image to Commons that was taken by a drone operated by me.
  * 🟢 2025-01-27: got my [EASA A1/A3 certificate](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/drones-air-mobility/operating-drone/open-category-low-risk-civil-drones)
  * 🔴 I did not manage to take an image that would be suitable for uploading to Commons.
* 🟢 Throughout the year, I engaged in daily Duolingo and Brilliant exercises, mainly to motivate my kids to learn something every day. I complemented this with occasional LingQ lessons, which I actually found more useful but they took more time, so I did not manage to stay engaged.
