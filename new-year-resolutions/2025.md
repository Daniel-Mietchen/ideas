# About 

This file hosts some draft ideas for my resolutions for 2025. The ones from [2024](2024.md) worked out reasonably well, so this year's are building on them. The main change is that I removed sustainability as a stand-alone item because I will increase my efforts to address sustainability in everything I am involved with. 

# The plan

In 2025, I will strive to do the following (游릭/游리/游댮 stand for good/ intermediate/ bad progress, relative to the completion of the year):

1. [Communities](#communities): keep more detailed track of my engagement with [communities](../communities/communities.md), consider my potential kinds and levels of engagement with them and alignment by [values](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/pledges), assess relevant impacts and on that basis explore systemic improvements &mdash; both within and across communities &mdash; towards more open knowledge sharing, lower environmental footprint and greater overall sustainability;
2. [Workflows](#workflows): check my own workflows for dependencies in more detail and explore ways to contribute to their respective sustainability or to switch to more sustainable ones;
3. [Practice](#practice): engage in a series of specific periods of targeted activities to learn and/ or to explore meaningful change, particularly in view of a lifestyle that is both healthy and sustainable;
4. [Documentation](#documentation): provide monthly updates here on progress with respect to the above, paying special attention to sustainability aspects.

# Documentation

Let's see how these ideas pan out over the course of the year. 

## Communities 

* 游리 2025-01-14: started [events.md](../communities/events.md) to keep track of events I am planning to attend.

## Workflows

* January:
  * 游리 started experimenting with using [BigBlueButton](https://bbb.wikipedia.de/) systematically for videoconferences.
  * 游리 started experimenting with using [DFN Terminplaner](https://terminplaner6.dfn.de) systematically for scheduling polls, as a complement to [Dudel](https://dud-poll.inf.tu-dresden.de/).

## Practice
* 游리 Throughout January, I am using [The Daily Dozen](https://nutritionfacts.org/daily-dozen/).
* 游리 Throughout Q1, I am recording my steps, aiming to reach a monthly average of at least 300,000, i.e. about 10,000 per day.
* 游리 By Q3, I plan to upload at least one image to Commons that was taken by a drone operated by me.
