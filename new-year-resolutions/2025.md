# About 

This file hosts some draft ideas for my resolutions for 2025. The ones from [2024](2024.md) worked out reasonably well, so this year's are building on them. The main change is that I removed sustainability as a stand-alone item because I will increase my efforts to address sustainability in everything I am involved with. I plan to keep this file in draft mode until January 5, 2025.

In 2025, I will strive to do the following (ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´ stand for good/ intermediate/ bad progress, relative to the completion of the year):

1. [Communities](#communities): keep more detailed track of my engagement with [communities](../communities/communities.md), consider my potential kinds and levels of engagement with them as well as possibilities to align our respective activities and [values](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/pledges), to assess impact and on that basis explore systemic improvements &mdash; both within and across communities &mdash; towards more open knowledge sharing, lower environmental footprint and greater overall sustainability;
2. [Workflows](#workflows): check my own workflows for dependencies in more detail and explore ways to contribute to their respective sustainability or to switch to more sustainable ones;
3. [Personal practice](#practice): engage in a series of at least month-long periods of specific activities to learn and/ or to explore meaningful change;
4. [Documentation](#documentation): provide monthly updates here on progress with respect to the above, paying special attention to sustainability aspects.
