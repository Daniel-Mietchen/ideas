# About

This file hosts some ideas for what might become new year resolutions in the future. As of 2025, this is just brainstorming, but comments and pull requests are welcome.

## Procedural

* Perhaps have some goals set in stone and others to be picked from a list, as for 2023, to keep some flexibility throughout the year alongside some coherent structure.

## Content

* Find a useful way to engage with the "Permanent-Emergency Climate Science Code of Practice" proposed [here](https://medium.com/@JacksonDamian/faster-than-expected-9675203cf8ac) (copy [here](https://dgrnewsservice.org/civilization/ecocide/climate-change/are-climate-scientists-in-denial-about-climate-change/)).
* Try to map to my long-term goals and pledges.
  * Try to link this to "victories for humanity"
* Formally publish my pledges.
* Formally publish my scientific will.
* Come up with a mechanism to compare the different kinds of impact of my activities (e.g. environmental impact vs. open knowledge impact)
* Make (and document) some efforts towards exploring alternatives to GitHub, especially [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/).
* Increase community engagement around some of the things I care about, especially
  * Wikimedia science
  * RIO
  * sustainability

# Further brainstorming

Some more ideas:
- [RIO at 10](#RIO): review recent developments in the research landscape while looking back at [10 years of RIO](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.1.e7547), looking around it and looking forward on that basis;
- try to keep track of my social and environmental impacts and especially their ratio
- [Open Science Conference](https://www.open-science-conference.eu/)
- [Wikidata and research](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikidata_and_research)
- 1 community per month; include associations as well as patreon and similar; sample candidate: https://ackersyndikat.org/
- Gotha
- graph split/ Scholia
- physical activity
- in general, map my activities to SDG/ WikiSusDev more systematically (see also [WikiSusDev Annual Plan 2025](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedians_for_Sustainable_Development/Annual_plan_2025) and [potential ideas](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedians_for_Sustainable_Development/Potential_activities))
- [Office of Carbon Omission](https://ainali.com/2024/launching-office-of-carbon-omission/)
- ca. 1 community event per month
- drones
