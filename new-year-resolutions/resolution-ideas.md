This file hosts some ideas for what might become new year resolutions in the future. As of 2025, this is just brainstorming, but comments and pull requests are welcome.

## Procedural

* Perhaps have some goals set in stone and others to be picked from a list, as for 2023, to keep some flexibility throughout the year alongside some coherent structure.

## Content

* Find a useful way to engage with the "Permanent-Emergency Climate Science Code of Practice" proposed [here](https://medium.com/@JacksonDamian/faster-than-expected-9675203cf8ac) (copy [here](https://dgrnewsservice.org/civilization/ecocide/climate-change/are-climate-scientists-in-denial-about-climate-change/)).
* Try to map to my long-term goals and pledges.
  * Try to link this to "victories for humanity"
* Formally publish my pledges.
* Formally publish my scientific will.
* Come up with a mechanism to compare the different kinds of impact of my activities (e.g. environmental impact vs. open knowledge impact)
* Make (and document) some efforts towards exploring alternatives to GitHub, especially [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/).
* Increase community engagement around some of the things I care about, especially
  * Wikimedia science
  * RIO
  * sustainability
