# Resolutions

*These resolutions will be activated on 31 December 2020 and be considered a draft until then.*

In 2021, I will strive to do the following:
- do at least one 28-day challenge each month;
- vary the focus of these challenges such that, as a group, they cover at least six of the [17 Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals);
- document progress in public (here or linked from here) on at least a monthly basis.


# Notes

*The notes below helped me with the framing of the 2021 resolutions. Not sure whether they will help me implement them.*

* On progress bars in Markdown, see [this StackOverflow ticket]()
  - example: ![42%](https://progress-bar.dev/42)
  - alternatively, ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´ can stand for good/ intermediate/ bad progress, relative to the completion of the year
* The challenges are inspired by the [100DaysOfJupyter](https://public.paws.wmcloud.org/12410844/100days/) that I did in 2020
* Make provisions about tracking important readings.
  - Candidates:
    - [Atomic Habits](https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/self-help/atomic-habits/)
* Make provisions about tracking what platforms I am registered on (especially conference apps), and purge the unused ones more regularly.
* Experiment more with GitLab
* Something about languages, e.g. via [Duolingo](https://duome.eu/EvoMRI) or [The Mixxer](https://www.language-exchanges.org/)
* Something about physical activity
* Something about musical instruments, especially accordeon
* Something about documenting my learnings, perhaps on a weekly (or even [daily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2V2kf2gNnI#t=36m15s)) basis
* Consider picking up some of the threads from "JupyterCon futures", as per [Day 25](https://public.paws.wmcloud.org/12410844/100days/100days-Day-025.ipynb).
* Something about systematically supporting crowdsourcing/ -funding initiatives that support sustainability, e.g. as per https://www.startnext.com/profile/danielmietchen .
  - example: [Klimawette](https://www.dieklimawette.de/)
* Something about sustainable finances ([some pointers](https://utopia.de/bestenlisten/die-besten-gruenen-banken/))
* Experiment with web hosting
  - some [starting points](https://collegeinfogeek.com/personal-website/)
* Learn more about the non-CO2 drivers of climate change
