# Resolutions

In 2021, I will strive to do the following:
1. [Principles](#principles): review and refine my [public pledges](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/pledges) on a monthly basis;
1. [Experimentation](#experimentation): finish at least one 28-day challenge each month;
1. [Persistence](#persistence): finish at least one 14-week challenge by the end of the year;
1. [Sustainability](#sustainability): vary the focus of these challenges such that, as a group, they cover at least six of the [17 Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals);
1. [Documentation](#documentation): document my progress regarding these goals in public on at least a monthly basis.

# Principles

* Feedback so far:
  - [a fork](https://github.com/Ainali/pledges)
  - consider [convincing others of the worthiness/necessity of adopting your (or similar) principles for themselves](https://twitter.com/kos2/status/1344991750436352000)

# Experimentation

* As of January 27, three challenges are ongoing:
  - for at least 28 days:
    - reach at least 30 XP per day on Duolingo (my main goal here is to improve my Korean, but I am working on other languages too; [rough progress indicator](https://duome.eu/EvoMRI))
    - do at least 30 squats    
  - already beyond 28 days:
    - measure my weight every day
    - do one more pushup than the day before
* Other challenges I am considering:
  - documenting what I am reading, similar to how I am [documenting what I am watching](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/datascience/blob/master/cinema.md)
    - candidate reads:
      - [Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution](https://peterkalmus.net/books/read-by-chapter-being-the-change/) by [Peter Kalmus](https://twitter.com/ClimateHuman)
  - track the carbon footprint of my food
    - e.g. as per [https://myemissions.green/food-carbon-footprint-calculator/](https://myemissions.green/food-carbon-footprint-calculator/)
  - estimate the carbon footprint for every year of my life so far
    - e.g. as per [https://twitter.com/manuelacasasoli/status/1345001734939279360](https://twitter.com/manuelacasasoli/status/1345001734939279360)
  - practice speed-reading
    - e.g. as per [this course I have begun](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-quick-guide-to-speed-reading/) and the [related TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2-ahs905MQ), with some critical review [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmDMrxUSXKY)
  - something around diversity of content in Wikidata, e.g. as per [52 weeks of Wikidata](https://ainali.com/2020/52-wikidata-weeks-2020/)
  - something involving live coding (probably going through some recorded sessions after the fact, as per [this nice example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGmXxpIj6vs))
  - something involving [Wikidojo](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikidojo)
  - something involving Duolingo, now that I finally managed to make the leagues disappear, using [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) as described [here](https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/33039989/How-to-block-the-Leagues); see my progress [here](https://duome.eu/EvoMRI)

# Persistence

  - any of the 28-day challenges might simply be continued or even repeated

# Sustainability

Apart from the challenges, my sustainability-related activities continue in various fashions, some of which will be mentioned below.

* 2021-01-08: I [signed](https://twitter.com/EvoMRI/status/1347666055175528451) (about 2h after number 3,287) an [open letter by March for Science that called for the removal of Donald Trump from office](http://web.archive.org/web/20210108221420/https://medium.com/march-for-science-news/sign-on-letter-march-for-science-calls-for-the-removal-of-president-donald-j-trump-8191da258919))
* 2021-01-01: I [signed](https://twitter.com/EvoMRI/status/1345163388444438534) (as number 3677) a [petition to the U.N. Security Council to declare a Global Climate Emergency](http://web.archive.org/web/20210102000524/https://www.now.world/global_climate_emergency), in line with a [similar recommendation](https://twitter.com/EvoMRI/status/1212213688465268736) I made a year earlier

# Documentation

*I am currently experimenting with how to map my own activities (especially the challenges, but other things too) to the [17 Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). Not sure yet how to do this in a concise fashion &mdash; [suggestions welcome](https://twitter.com/EvoMRI/status/1350430876535025665).*

# Notes

*The notes below helped me with the framing of the 2021 resolutions. Not sure whether they will help me implement them.*

* On progress bars in Markdown, see [this StackOverflow ticket](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24768630/is-there-a-way-to-show-a-progressbar-on-github-wiki)
  - example: ![42%](https://progress-bar.dev/42)
  - alternatively, ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´ can stand for good/ intermediate/ bad progress, relative to the completion of the year
* The challenges are inspired by the [100DaysOfJupyter](https://public.paws.wmcloud.org/12410844/100days/) that I did in 2020
* The documentation of progress could take place here in this document. If that is not the case, the other place should be linked from here.
* Make provisions about tracking important readings.
  - Candidates:
    - [Atomic Habits](https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/self-help/atomic-habits/)
* Make provisions about tracking what platforms I am registered on (especially conference apps), and purge the unused ones more regularly.
* Experiment more with GitLab
* Something about languages, e.g. via [Duolingo](https://duome.eu/EvoMRI) or [The Mixxer](https://www.language-exchanges.org/)
* Something about physical activity
* Something about musical instruments, especially accordeon
* Something about documenting my learnings, perhaps on a weekly (or even [daily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2V2kf2gNnI#t=36m15s)) basis
* Consider picking up some of the threads from "JupyterCon futures", as per [Day 25](https://public.paws.wmcloud.org/12410844/100days/100days-Day-025.ipynb).
* Something about systematically supporting crowdsourcing/ -funding initiatives that support sustainability, e.g. as per https://www.startnext.com/profile/danielmietchen .
  - example: [Klimawette](https://www.dieklimawette.de/)
* Something about sustainable finances ([some pointers](https://utopia.de/bestenlisten/die-besten-gruenen-banken/))
* Experiment with web hosting
  - some [starting points](https://collegeinfogeek.com/personal-website/)
* Learn more about the non-CO2 drivers of climate change
