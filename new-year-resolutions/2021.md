# Resolutions

In 2021, I will strive to do the following:
1. [Principles](#principles): review and refine my [public pledges](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/pledges) on a monthly basis;
1. [Experimentation](#experimentation): finish at least one 28-day challenge each month;
1. [Persistence](#persistence): finish at least one 14-week challenge by the end of the year;
1. [Sustainability](#sustainability): vary the focus of these challenges such that, as a group, they cover at least six of the [17 Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals);
1. [Documentation](#documentation): document my progress regarding these goals in public on at least a monthly basis.

# Principles

* Feedback so far:
  - [forks](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/pledges/network/members)
  - consider [convincing others of the worthiness/necessity of adopting your (or similar) principles for themselves](https://twitter.com/kos2/status/1344991750436352000)
* > Best advice I got when I entered academia: "We're all smart. Distinguish yourself by being kind."
  - heard via [Bruce Caron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVaqJYPCYF0#t=22m9s)
    - then [this Twitter search](https://twitter.com/search?q=everyone%20here%20is%20smart%20distinguish%20kind%20&src=typed_query&f=live), which gave
      - [this related tweet](https://twitter.com/dolly_sud/status/1213571665826910211)
      - [the original](https://twitter.com/annegalloway/status/438412389319319552) (perhaps)
  - write-ups:
    - [Should we steer clear of the winner-takes-all approach?](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-018-00482-y)
    - partly based on [Being Kind](https://freshwater-science.org/news/presidents-environment-being-kind)
  - [“The level and quality of current knowing in any science discipline increases as the square of the number of scientists times the amount of available conversation.”](https://cybersocialstructure.org/2020/03/21/knowing-and-conversation-in-the-academy/) (seen via [the same Bruce Caron video as above](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVaqJYPCYF0#t=27m))
* think about adding something on material licenses, e.g. hardware, seeds, cell lines, ice cores etc.

# Experimentation

* As of June 30, these challenges are ongoing:
  - for at least 100 days:
    - reach at least 30 XP per day on Duolingo
      - my main goal here is to improve my Korean, but I am working on other languages too; [rough progress indicator](https://duome.eu/EvoMRI)
      - in order to actually enjoy using the platform, I had to make the annoying leagues disappear, using [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) as described [here](https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/33039989/How-to-block-the-Leagues)
  - already beyond 28 days:
    - measure my weight every day
    - do one more pushup than the day before
  - canceled before 28 days:
    - do at least 30 squats a day
      - I have incorporated squats instead into a more versatile daily exercise routine
* Other challenges I am considering:
  - 100 days of science and sustainability 
  - documenting what I am reading, similar to how I am [documenting what I am watching](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/datascience/blob/master/cinema.md), perhaps focusing on those things that triggered something I did based on that read
    - what I actually read (still only a sketch):
      - 2021-02-08: 
        - [Why I Still Use RSS](https://atthis.link/blog/2021/rss.html)
        - [Being Kind](https://freshwater-science.org/news/presidents-environment-being-kind)

  - something involving live coding (probably going through some recorded sessions after the fact, as per [this nice example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGmXxpIj6vs))
  - something involving [Wikidojo](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikidojo)
  - something around tree planting, e.g. via [Plant for the Planet](https://www1.plant-for-the-planet.org/)
  - something like the [Drawdown Ecochallenge](https://drawdown.ecochallenge.org/)
  - [21 days of machine learning](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-machine-learning-in-21-days/)

# Persistence

  - any of the 28-day challenges might simply be continued or even repeated

# Sustainability

Apart from the challenges, my sustainability-related activities continue in various fashions, some of which will be mentioned below.

I am taking inspiration from a variety of sources on the matter. Here are some of those that I found particularly engaging:
* the paper [How norms, needs, and power in science obstruct transformations towards sustainability](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abdcf0), which has quotes [an earlier one](https://ru.on.worldcat.org/v2/search/detail/518272710) (that I do not have access to) as follows:
* >  Scientific processes must be opened up, allowing insight into their workings, and made transparent; scientists and their organizations must be made to bear social and political responsibility; the scientific system must be more closely bound to other subsystems of civil society.
  * This is pretty close to a summary of what I have been trying to work on for the last decade.
* the post [We Need to See the Whole Board to Stop Climate Change](https://globalecoguy.org/we-need-to-see-the-whole-board-to-stop-climate-change-98be66412281), from which I am reproducing the following figure:

# Documentation

*I am currently experimenting with how to map my own activities (especially the challenges, but other things too) to the [17 Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). Not sure yet how to do this in a concise fashion &mdash; [suggestions welcome](https://twitter.com/EvoMRI/status/1350430876535025665).*

Here, too, I am adding an image from the post [We Need to See the Whole Board to Stop Climate Change](https://globalecoguy.org/we-need-to-see-the-whole-board-to-stop-climate-change-98be66412281) already mentioned above:

# Notes

*The notes below helped me with the framing of the 2021 resolutions. Not sure whether they will help me implement them.*

* On progress bars in Markdown, see [this StackOverflow ticket](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24768630/is-there-a-way-to-show-a-progressbar-on-github-wiki)
  - example: ![42%](https://progress-bar.dev/42)
  - alternatively, 🟢/🟡/🔴 can stand for good/ intermediate/ bad progress, relative to the completion of the year
* The challenges are inspired by the [100DaysOfJupyter](https://public.paws.wmcloud.org/12410844/100days/) that I did in 2020
* The documentation of progress could take place here in this document. If that is not the case, the other place should be linked from here.
* Make provisions about tracking important readings.
  - Candidates:
    - [Atomic Habits](https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/self-help/atomic-habits/)
* Make provisions about tracking what platforms I am registered on (especially conference apps), and purge the unused ones more regularly.
* Experiment more with GitLab
* Something about languages, e.g. via [Duolingo](https://duome.eu/EvoMRI) or [The Mixxer](https://www.language-exchanges.org/)
* Something about physical activity
* Something about musical instruments, especially accordeon
* Something about documenting my learnings, perhaps on a weekly (or even [daily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2V2kf2gNnI#t=36m15s)) basis
* Consider picking up some of the threads from "JupyterCon futures", as per [Day 25](https://public.paws.wmcloud.org/12410844/100days/100days-Day-025.ipynb).
* Something about systematically supporting crowdsourcing/ -funding initiatives that support sustainability, e.g. as per https://www.startnext.com/profile/danielmietchen .
  - example: [Klimawette](https://www.dieklimawette.de/)
* Something about sustainable finances ([some pointers](https://utopia.de/bestenlisten/die-besten-gruenen-banken/))
* Experiment with web hosting
  - some [starting points](https://collegeinfogeek.com/personal-website/)
* Learn more about the non-CO2 drivers of climate change
