# Resolutions

In 2021, I will strive to do the following:
1. [Principles](#principles): review and refine my [public pledges](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/pledges) on a monthly basis;
1. [Experimentation](#experimentation): finish at least one 28-day challenge each month;
1. [Persistence](#persistence): finish at least one 14-week challenge by the end of the year;
1. [Sustainability](#sustainability): vary the focus of these challenges such that, as a group, they cover at least six of the [17 Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals);
1. [Documentation](#documentation): document my progress regarding these goals in public on at least a monthly basis.

# Notes

*The notes below helped me with the framing of the 2021 resolutions. Not sure whether they will help me implement them.*

* On progress bars in Markdown, see [this StackOverflow ticket]()
  - example: ![42%](https://progress-bar.dev/42)
  - alternatively, ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´ can stand for good/ intermediate/ bad progress, relative to the completion of the year
* The challenges are inspired by the [100DaysOfJupyter](https://public.paws.wmcloud.org/12410844/100days/) that I did in 2020
* The documentation of progress could take place here in this document. If that is not the case, the other place should be linked from here.
* Make provisions about tracking important readings.
  - Candidates:
    - [Atomic Habits](https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/self-help/atomic-habits/)
* Make provisions about tracking what platforms I am registered on (especially conference apps), and purge the unused ones more regularly.
* Experiment more with GitLab
* Something about languages, e.g. via [Duolingo](https://duome.eu/EvoMRI) or [The Mixxer](https://www.language-exchanges.org/)
* Something about physical activity
* Something about musical instruments, especially accordeon
* Something about documenting my learnings, perhaps on a weekly (or even [daily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2V2kf2gNnI#t=36m15s)) basis
* Consider picking up some of the threads from "JupyterCon futures", as per [Day 25](https://public.paws.wmcloud.org/12410844/100days/100days-Day-025.ipynb).
* Something about systematically supporting crowdsourcing/ -funding initiatives that support sustainability, e.g. as per https://www.startnext.com/profile/danielmietchen .
  - example: [Klimawette](https://www.dieklimawette.de/)
* Something about sustainable finances ([some pointers](https://utopia.de/bestenlisten/die-besten-gruenen-banken/))
* Experiment with web hosting
  - some [starting points](https://collegeinfogeek.com/personal-website/)
* Learn more about the non-CO2 drivers of climate change
