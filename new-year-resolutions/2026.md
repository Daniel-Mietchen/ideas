# About 

This file hosts some draft ideas for my resolutions for 2026. Until Jan 6, 2026, this file's content is preliminary.

Ideas:
- learn accordion enough to be able to perform on it for half an hour
- do something closely tied to the current or upcoming year(s), e.g.
  - the [250th birthday of Carl Friedrich Gau√ü](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benutzer:Brunswyk/250CFG)
  - 10 years since the first WikiCite conference
  - 25 years of Wikipedia
