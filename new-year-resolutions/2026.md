# About

This file hosts the public part of my resolutions for 2026, following up on those from [2025](2025.md) and previous years. 

# The plan

My focus this year is on personal and family matters that I do not plan to dwell on here, and the most publicly visible effects will likely be higher frequencies of me saying "no" to things you might know as being of interest to me. This means I will travel less (see [communities/events.md](../communities/events.md)), I will try hard to resist the urge to jump onto new exciting endeavours, and I will also stop engaging in some other areas. I will remain active with [RIO](https://riojournal.com/), [Scholia](https://scholia.toolforge.org/) and [nanopublications](https://nanodash.petapico.org/list?30&userid=https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9488-1870) as usual but not much beyond that.

Besides that, I will strive to continue to do the following (🟢/🟡/🔴 stand for good/ intermediate/ bad progress, relative to the completion of the year):

1. [Communities](#communities): keep track of my engagement with [communities](../communities/communities.md), consider my actual and potential kinds and levels of engagement with them and alignment by [values](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/pledges);
2. [Workflows](#workflows): check my own workflows for dependencies and explore ways to increase their overall sustainability.

# Other points to consider

Let's see how these ideas pan out over the course of the year. 

Ideas:
- learn accordion enough to be able to perform on it for half an hour
  - perhaps more realistic for next year 
- do something closely tied to the current or upcoming year(s), e.g.
  - the [250th birthday of Carl Friedrich Gauß](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benutzer:Brunswyk/250CFG)
  - 10 years since the first WikiCite conference
  - 10 years of Scholia
  - 25 years of Wikipedia
