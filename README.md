# About

This repo is for keeping and possibly developing ideas (and I am mainly thinking of research ideas here, though in a broad sense) that I 
* cannot immediately put into practice myself
* think may be worth another look, including by people who come in here via search engines

I am also experimenting with using this repo for managing some of my to-do stuff in general, so not just broad ideas but also small things to do when I have [5 min](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A5min) of time, [an hour](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A1h) or [a day](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A1day). While many of these things are one-off, there are also [recurring activities](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Acreated-asc+label%3Arecurring).

# Mechanics

I have yet to figure this out in detail, but probably mainly via issues, perhaps with the "[documentation](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adocumentation)" label for things that are about the repo rather than about research ideas. Some of the research ideas may end up in the [Journal of Brief Ideas](http://beta.briefideas.org/), others in [Research Ideas and Outcomes](http://riojournal.com/browse_journal_articles.php?form_name=filter_articles&selfurl=&backurl=&sortby=0&journal_id=17&search_hidden=&search_in_=0&search_in_hidden=&alerts_subject_cats=&alerts_sdg_cats=&from_date=&to_date=&section_type%5B%5D=179&funding_agency=), while yet others may go elsewhere or simply stay here.
