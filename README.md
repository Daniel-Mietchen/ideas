# About

This repo is for keeping and possibly developing ideas (and I am mainly thinking of research ideas here, though in a broad sense) that I 
* cannot immediately put into practice
* think may be worth another look

# Mechanics

I have yet to figure this out in detail, but probably mainly via issues, perhaps with a "meta" label for things that are about the repo rather than about research ideas.
