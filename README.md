# About

This repo is for keeping and possibly developing ideas (and I am mainly thinking of research ideas here, though in a broad sense) that I 
* cannot immediately put into practice myself
* think may be worth another look, including by people who come in here via search engines

I am also experimenting with using this repo for managing to-do stuff in general, so not just broad ideas but also small things to do when I have 5 min or an hour of time.

# Mechanics

I have yet to figure this out in detail, but probably mainly via issues, perhaps with a "meta" label for things that are about the repo rather than about research ideas. Some of the research ideas may end up in the [Journal of Brief Ideas](http://beta.briefideas.org/), others in [Research Ideas and Outcomes](http://riojournal.com/browse_journal_articles.php?form_name=filter_articles&selfurl=&backurl=&sortby=0&journal_id=17&search_hidden=&search_in_=0&search_in_hidden=&alerts_subject_cats=&alerts_sdg_cats=&from_date=&to_date=&section_type%5B%5D=179&funding_agency=), while others may simply stay here.
